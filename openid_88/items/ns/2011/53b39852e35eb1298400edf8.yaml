    text: 'A White-necked Heron visited the fairly new wetland near our house early inf the afternoon - first time seen here.  Later in the day it returned and was joined by this Yellow-billed Spoonbill.  They were in no hurry to go and the Spoonbill just stroller around while the Heron was in the water.  Very exciting first sightings of both for us. '
