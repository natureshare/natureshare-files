      Yellow flowers of St John's wort - Hypericum perforatum.
      Gapstead Nature Reserve.
      Ovens Valley.
      N.E. Victoria.

      There are many types of Hypericum. The petals of this one have jagged edges.
      It is native to Europe, and is a wide spread weed, especially in disturbed ground and roadsides.
