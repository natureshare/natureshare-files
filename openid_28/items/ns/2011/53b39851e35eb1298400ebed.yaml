      Scarlet pimpernel - Anagallis arvensis (also known as red pimpernel, red chickweed, poorman's barometer, shepherd's weather glass or shepherd's clock) is a low-growing annual plant found in Europe, Asia and North America. The barometer (weather glass) common names have their origin in the fact that the flowers close when atmospheric pressure decreases and bad weather is approaching.
