      Large Duck Orchid - <i>Caleana major</i>.

      The head-like labellum is supported by a sensitive, curved strap that snaps into the 'body' when an insect lands on the plant.The escape route for the insect ensures that pollen sacs are deposited on its body, ready for transfer to another flower.
      They are widespread throughout Victoria, but not common.
