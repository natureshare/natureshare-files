    text: 'In Flora of Victoria, <i>Dianella admixta</i> was included in the circumscription of the widespread species D. revoluta.  A revision of this group is currently in progress and it is anticipated that eight taxa in Victoria (D. admixta and seven others) will be segregated from <b>D. revoluta</b>, as indicated in the 7th edition of A Census of the Vascular Plants of Victoria.
