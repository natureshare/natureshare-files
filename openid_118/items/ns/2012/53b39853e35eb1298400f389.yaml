      Comment from Russell Best:

      'Delias harpalyce (Imperial Jezebel).
      Its host plant is mistletoe (Amyema species, so Amyema pendula here) which is plentiful in the forests around here. (host plant means the plant that the caterpillar lives on exclusively in its life phase)

      Your pics on picasa are very interesting and very useful too because all the wing upper side shots are female but what I see as pic 4 or 14 is male - much whiter and much thinner black edge to the wing upperside.'
