    text: Looks like the Westringia glabra growing in my garden. Rare in Victoria but known in the Lerdederg. A better view of the leaves/stems would help id. although it seems to be a good match.

    text: This is a Westringia not a Prostanthera. The calyx lobes on Prostanthera are one upper and one lower - both oval shaped. On Westringia the calyx lobes are pointed like this plant and from memory there are five lobes
