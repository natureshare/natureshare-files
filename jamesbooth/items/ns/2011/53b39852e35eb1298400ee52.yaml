    text: 'Can you take more pics of plants at this location this year? Some flowers are emanating two per node rather than the usual one per node for strictum s.s.. Also, the flower on this one has white anther appendages (the white bits at the base of anther) - I''d like to see if they are like this on other plants, purple or yellow.'
