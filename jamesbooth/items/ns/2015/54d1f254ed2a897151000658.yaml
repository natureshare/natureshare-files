    text: 'I agree it looks like one of these two but neither has been recorded in that area previously. James, can you let us more about its habit - tree, shrub and is there evidence of recent flowering? A. (h)omalophylla is the only thing close that has been recorded there but that doesn''t seem quote right.'

    text: 'Saw two plants, both approximately 50cm tall. Could have been due to macropod grazing. No evidence of flowering.'
