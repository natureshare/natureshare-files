description: 'A fuzzy photo taken by a colleague today with a point-and-shoot camera of a flowering male Pimelea spinescens plant at Mount Cottrell, with what appears to be a pollinator in action.  In another image the insect has its head inside the flower.  Pollinators for Critically Endangered Spiny Rice-flower are not yet known, so we''d love to know what this creature is, at least to family if possible.'
