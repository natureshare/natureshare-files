    text: 'I think this is a Calotis, possibly C. scabiosifolia var. integrifolia, but that seems to be a very rare beast in this part of Victoria. I will go back and try for a proper photo - this is a crop from a quick mobile phone snap to remind me to look.'

    text: 'Hi, lower quality photos, especially those with GPS locations, are extremely useful to NS and ALA for plotting distributions and so forth. A better photo later is also welcome for identification purposes but plz donâ€™t ever feel it is required. Thanks!'

    text: If you might be interested in meeting up at some point I would very much like to learn more about that history and hear any suggestions you may have for how NS could include more data-focused features?
