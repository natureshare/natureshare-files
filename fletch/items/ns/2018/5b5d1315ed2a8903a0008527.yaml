    text: 'The Tremella species (Jelly fungi) feed on other fungi, especially Stereum species. This appears to be an old, rain affected Tremella and the bracket fungus looks a lot like Stereum ostrea (now Stereum versicolor) which fits the wet climate of the location, but it could also be Stereum hirsutum. You have not entered the location on this image, but given your other images are near Mt Sabine, I have made an assumption on the location.'
