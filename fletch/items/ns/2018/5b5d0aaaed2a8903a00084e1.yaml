    text: 'It can be very difficult (and often impossible) to identify fungi species from photographs and sharp focus is important to see the finer details that help. This could be Clitocybe clitocyboides (as listed in most field guides) which has been renamed and is now Singerocybe clitocyboides. I cannot be sure though, so best leave it unidentified.'
