description: 'Ellena Best aged 10 exclaimed "Hey Mum there''s a King Parrot!" And sure enough. It is the first time a King Parrot has been recorded on our property. It flew down to the deck and sat on a pole and then sat on the water heater. Its distinctive call could be heard in the surrounding forest. '
