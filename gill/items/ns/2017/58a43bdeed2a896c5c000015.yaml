    text: 'Either Trictena atripalpis or Abantiades labyrinthicus. I find the two difficult to separate, but might be easier if I knew what to look for. The wing patterns are so highly variable.'

    text: I think this is Abantiades labryinthicus looking at the posterior margins of fore wing.  It is heavily designed where as this is not so in the Trictena atripalpis.
