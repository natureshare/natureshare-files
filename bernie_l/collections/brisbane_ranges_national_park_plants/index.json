   "title": "Caladenia fuscata",
   "content_text": "White coloured C fuscata (Dusky Fingers). ID'd on the basis of features such as the forward-pointing triangular extensions on mid-lobes, lack of yellow on lip/tip of labellum, glands on back of dorsal sepal and underneath sepals and petals. However noted a lack of prominent red transverse stripes on and underneath the labellum. Other C. fuscata nearby displayed the stripes extending further up the lobes and underneath the labellum. Just a variation perhaps in this plant? 4 pics.",
