    text: 'Posted images of 3 different plants, all of which look to be C. catenata. Checked with local experts and there is discussion on the species with views that they may instead be C. carnea (a variable species). Any comments appreciated. Thanks. '

    text: 'Hi Bernie, my opinion is that all your plants are catenata. I think the variable species you are referring to may be maritima, the angahook fingers. I have photographed both species at Anglesea and compared them to your photos. As well as catenata photos from other areas. You could send the shots to Margaret MacDonald for her opinion. Cheers. Mark'
