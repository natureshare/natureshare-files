    text: 'John and Zeke I managed to find another specimen of the inkcap (?) observed 4 weeks ago. This looks to be an older specimen as the cap is disintegrating. Only one specimen observed over a 60 minute walk of the area. '

    text: Many thanks for the ID. Is the previous name Coprinus virgulicolens ? I've found different spellings of Parasola virgulicolens - also Parasola virgulacolens. Could you please advise which name/spelling should be added to the database?

    text: I'd stick with the Atlas it has it as Coprinus virgulacolens. I'm not sure but I think Coprinus has been revised. I'm not sure where my spelling came from.
