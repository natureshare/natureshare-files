description: 'A single Glyphipterix meteora moth. Other Glyphipterix meteora moths had been observed on Burchardia umbellata (Milkmaids) the previous day. Interesting to see a similar photo by Russell Best (below) in this Lobelia species list with the same moths, plus a beetle. As mentioned by Russell Best the moth appears to be feeding from below.'

    text: Bernie I'm not sure that this is L. pedunculata. It may be Lobelia pratioides. Is that on the OGNR list?
