    text: "Suzanne.  Here is a link to PaDIL\r\nIt is image #21 (offscreen) so you will need to click numerous times on the large image to scroll past the other 20 images.  \r\nThis is possibly the most commonly seen leaf beetle and the larvae are mostly quite distinctive for each species.   Peter Kelly used to breed them, therefore some good life cycle images are available on this site."
