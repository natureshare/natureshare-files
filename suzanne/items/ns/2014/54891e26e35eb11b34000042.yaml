    text: 'No.  I had sent him some specimens and he had wondered if these photos might have been of the Parakontikia atrata that I had sent him.  But we hadn''t sent this particular flatworm.  We had let it go in the wet grass.  I guess this photo would be of either Parakontikia atrata or Parakontikia ventrolineata, but can''t judge by these particular photos.  Sorry.  My later observation on Natureshare of a flatworm on a strawberry is of Parakontikia ventrolineata.  You can see the stripes in the photo, but stripes are not apparent in these two photos.'
