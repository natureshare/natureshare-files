description: 'This moth was very small, maybe 6mm in length.  It was also sitting quietly in a crevice of the bricks of the house, during daylight hours.  In the top photo, the head is pointing downwards.  The other two photos have both been rotated and the moth''s head is on the right.  Sorry I couldn''t get better photos.'
