description: This tiny green spider was picked with some flowers and ended up in a drop of water on the sink.  I was surprised that all it seemed to want to do was to stand on its head!  If it had walked two steps it would have been out of the water!  I wondered why that behaviour.  Was it to keep the spiracles on the abdomen out of the water??  I carried it outside on a knife and let it go.  The second last photo shows the markings under the abdomen.
