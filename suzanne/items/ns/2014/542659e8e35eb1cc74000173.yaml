    text: Great find. Where did you find the caterpillar? The host plants are all grasses for this species.

    text: 'This caterpillar was on our back doormat this morning.  I photographed it and was unsure if it was alive or not, then put it at the base of a bush.  An hour later I went and looked.  It was gone and when I lifted a piece of bark nearby, the caterpillar was underneath, so I would guess it is ready to pupate - definitely not dead.  The doormat where it was found is not far from the Microlaena stipoides lawn.'
