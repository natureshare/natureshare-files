    text: 'Yes, they do. Maybe it is family Zodariidae.  I have put it on Bowerbird, but it hasn''t been identified by anyone. Might just label it Araneae. Maybe the colours are a bit bright for a White tail too. It was most distinctive in the way it sat with four legs above the head, all reaching about the same length.  Quite small and very slender.'
