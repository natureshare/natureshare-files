description: 'There were many Nitidulidae beetles inside the compost bin, on top of the soil.  Most of them seemed to have at least one red mite attached to them.  Some beetles, like this one, carried a heavy load of mites.  The mites were identified by a mite expert, via Ken Walker, as being a species of Mesostigmata.'
