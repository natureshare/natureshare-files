description: "Teresa, on Bowerbird website, has confirmed my recent suspicion that these photos are of the sporangium of a Slime mould.  She called them a Myxomycetes and said they are possibly a Physarum species.\r\nThese 'black blobs' were on the Microlaena stipoides (Weeping grass) for only a few days, then disappeared.  They covered an area of at least 1.5 metres, possibly more. "
