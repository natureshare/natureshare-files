description: These tiny insects were identified as Psychodidae spp. (Moth flies) by Lek and by Graeme Cocks.  Ken Walker agreed with their identification after initially thinking they were Aleyrodidae spp. (sap sucking Whitefly).  The insects were very small and are pictured on a garden planted Leucadendron.
