description: 'This fly has been identified as Exaireta spinigera (family Stratiomyidae), by Ken Walker.  But - it has also been identified as being of family: Therevidae  and in sub-family Agapophytinae by Tony Daley.  I am unsure which identification is correct, but from my limited resources (photos in books) it does look like Stratiomyidae.'
