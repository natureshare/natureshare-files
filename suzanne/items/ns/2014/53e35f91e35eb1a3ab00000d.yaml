description: 'This Plague Soldier beetle looked like it was performing gymnastics.  Maybe it had an itch - I have no idea why it was twisting its body and legs in all directions, but it was doing it for long enough for me to take at least a dozen photos before it flew away.  It is on a Stenanthemom scortechini bush.'
