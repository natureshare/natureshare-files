    text: "Dear Suzanne Jones,\r\nI'm writing from the BBC Natural History Unit in Bristol where we are hoping to film a story about the gum leaf skeletoniser - Uraba lugens. I see your incredible pictures, and wondered if you had managed to get any footage of them? We are really hoping to film some while we are out in Australia too, so if you know where we could get hold of some do let me know. You can contact me on jolyon.sutcliffe@bbc.co.uk\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\n\r\nJolyon"
