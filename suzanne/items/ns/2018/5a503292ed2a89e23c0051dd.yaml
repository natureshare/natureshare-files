    text: Suzanne - I think this is Agrotis munda but the forewings appear to be not fully formed (length seems much shorter than normal but the markings including the crest above the antennae are what one would expect with this species.

    text: 'Thanks Cathy, I will put that as the species I.D. then.  Probably why it was crawling along the dirt if its wings were not functional.'
