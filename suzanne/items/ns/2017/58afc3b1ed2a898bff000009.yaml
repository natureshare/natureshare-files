    text: What a treat. I have only seen them in dense forest. Maybe it is on migration to be in open country.

    text: 'Don''t know.  First time I have ever seen one.  There were a lot of birds around the birdbaths at the time, but this one was so quick, all I got was a flash of orange on so many photos.  It seemed to be quite happy to be with the Grey Fantails on the birdbath.'
