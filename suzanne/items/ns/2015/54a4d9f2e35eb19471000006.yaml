description: 'This big bird was sitting in our birdbath.  It has been identified by Albert Golden as a Collared Sparrowhawk.  He commented that the long middle toe and ''goggle'' eyes identified it as such.  It would have been sitting (as in the first photo) for at least 5 minutes while we were watching.  It did look at me standing in the doorway with the camera, but appeared unperturbed.  It then flew to a nearby tree (scattering little birds in all directions), then flew back to the birdbath, where it sat on the lip for another 5 minutes or thereabouts before flying away.  '

    text: Amazing. I've never seen a raptor at a bird bath before. And it took this picture to make me realise I've never seen a raptor at a bird bath before!

    text: A lovely series of photos Suzanne. I agree with Brown Goshawk and possibly a young bird. Did you see it drinking at the bird bath or did it come in to flush smaller birds?

    text: 'It was just sitting in the birdbath when we first noticed it as we were having our breakfast and I ran for the camera.  Didn''t actually see it drink, but it was sitting in the middle of the birdbath when we noticed it was there.  It was in no hurry to move.  When it flew to a nearby tree, little birds scattered, but it didn''t make any move to follow any of them.  It then flew back to the birdbath where it sat on the lip for quite a while, turning around at times with its back facing me.  I took so many photos!!! '

    text: 'Very difficult call to make for identification. The legs and toes look a little too stout for Sparrowhawk (in my mind). Would love to know the tell-tale features of this bird. Perhaps the approachability hints of Sparrowhawk, with Brown Goshawk usually very secretive. Cheers.'

    text: 'Yes, I just don''t know.  One of my books says that the Sparrowhawk has a squared tail, but unfortunately we have a bush planted in front of the birdbath and the end of the tail can''t be seen in any of my many photos.'
