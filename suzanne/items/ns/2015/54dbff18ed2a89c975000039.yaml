description: 'This small delicate bug (approx. 8mm in body length) was found walking on our kitchen bench.  I was confused as to why it didn''t have long wings like the Berytidae spp. I had found in the past, but Tony Daley confirmed that it was Berytidae spp. and that some adults seem to have long wings and some short.  He said that this specimen is a male. '

    text: What a fascinating little gadget. Those antennae resemble the legs with a 'knee' halfway. Pholcidae mimicry maybe?
