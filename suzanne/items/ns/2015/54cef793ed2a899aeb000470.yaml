description: 'This young eucalypt tree had been surrounded by a plastic surround (that was put on when the tree was planted).  We saw that the area between the trunk of the tree and the plastic had been filled with dirt to about 8" or so up the bag.  So we removed the plastic and discovered that the dirt was a bullant nest and they were not happy with the destruction of their home.  I took just a few photos, then after five minutes or so went back and got more photos when the bullants were occupied collecting their pupa family members and taking them underground.'
