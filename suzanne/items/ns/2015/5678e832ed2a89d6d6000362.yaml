    text: I have no idea.  Possibly.  Only noticed the nest because we were cleaning up a large bush that had blown over not far away and the mother flew in to the Eucalyptus wimmerensis and fed the babies while I was only a few feet away.  She didn't seem bothered by me standing there.  Amazed us that the nest was still intact and the babies inside after the terrible winds that we had on Sunday.
