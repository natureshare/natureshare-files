    text: 'Yes, very similar.  I really don''t know, but this one looked identical to one on Bowerbird put on by "Gippsland Lakes to the Sea'' and identified by Martin Lagerwey as P. nobilitata, in which he commented that P. gloriosa was very similar but had smaller spots.  Personally, I just don''t know!'
