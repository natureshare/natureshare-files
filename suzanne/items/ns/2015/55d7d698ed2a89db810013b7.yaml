    text: 'We have quite a number of Leptospermum plants, of many different species, but think that those that have any L. polygalifolium in them are still small plants, probably less than a year old and we have found that L. polygalifolium ''Cardwell'' is severely affected by the frost here.  Those young plants are not looking good at the moment.  We also have young plants of L. ''Tickled Pink'', L. ''Pink Cascade'' and L. ''Outrageous, all of which are hybrids with L. polygalifolium as one of the parents.  We do have one very large nine year old Leptospermum ''Copper Glow'' growing in the front garden.  I always thought that it was L. petersonii, but I just looked up Wrigley & Fagg book and it says it is L. polygalifolium.  I just don''t know.  This particular beetle was not found on a bush.  It flew onto Graeme''s hand and he called me to get the camera.  After several photos, it decided it had had enough and took off!'
