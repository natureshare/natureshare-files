    text: Amazing. You have much better vision than I for sure. John La Salle recently told me the smallest insects known are wasps.

    text: 'Actually, my vision is not that good.  Great to be able to look at insects through the camera and see them in better detail.  When my husband had said to me "Do you want a photo of this?"  I had replied "Photo of what?", it was so very tiny, perched on his finger!  '
