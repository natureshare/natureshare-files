    text: Agree with David - Brown Thornbill. Would suggest an adult or near-adult bird.

    text: 'Thanks.  We thought juvenile, mainly because it was so quiet, but I really didn''t know.  Didn''t panic at all when we approached it.'

    text: 'Thanks.  Not sure what is on its foot - maybe cobweb??  We didn''t notice it at the time I took the photos.  The bird was very quiet and approachable.  Graeme just opened the shed window a bit wider and it flew away.  '
