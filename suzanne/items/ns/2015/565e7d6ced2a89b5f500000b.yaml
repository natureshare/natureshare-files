    text: 'Yes, they are a striking looking insect.  The first one I ever found was asleep on a shrub I was cutting back.  I looked at this strange thing on the cutting and had no idea whatever it could be.  It must have been in a very heavy sleep!  Finding out about it, fueled my interest in native bees.  '
