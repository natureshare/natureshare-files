    text: Viridans doesn't seem to have this plant in this part of Victoria at all. Two observations by Kevin Sparrow and this one seems to fit - wrong ID or new area for them!??

    text: T. pilosa has alternate leaves and this may be the case for your plant as the apparent whorls are rather haphazard. Within the range would be T. pilosa subsp.latifolia.
