    text: 'Seems to be a name change - C gracilis not in Flora of Vic. My books still have C gracilis. (From Flora of Vic) Difficult to distinguish from Caladenia moschata differs from C. cucullata in having generally larger, non-compressed (vertically), strongly fragrant flowers in a longer, less compact raceme. Caladenia moschata is more widespread than C. cucullata, and is found in most areas (except mallee) where the latter species grows.'
