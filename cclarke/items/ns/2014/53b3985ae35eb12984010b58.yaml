    text: Yes - maybe we have all been playing follow the leader on that one? Did our Moth Man ID any early ones? I just posted another that looks more like the wing pattern of P.tristifica. Cheers.

    text: 'The Moth Man - Peter Marriott - hasn''t posted one of these moths, but he possibly identified some earlier ones posted in previous version of NS. Perhaps he wouldnt mind checking over them all. Cheers.'
