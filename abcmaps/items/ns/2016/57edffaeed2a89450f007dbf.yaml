description: 'My uneducated guess is H.empetrifolia but I have some doubt as I cannot see any pics of that species on natureshare. Showy plant at the moment which trails, scrambles and climbs over other plants and logs. Locally common in Gembrook area. Please comment if I.D. is incorrect and I will change it. Underside of foliage has fine sparse hairs along the vein which appears to concur with Vicflora description.'
