    text: What is the shape of the leaf? Are they normal flowers or buds?

    text: Has the appearance of Olearia lirata - seedling or young plant. The growth looks to be caused by fungal or insect attack.

    text: Thanks. Have added a second image but I'm not sure if you will get much more out of that one. The Olearia lirata are just starting to flower so I might go back and see if there are any nearby and compare leaves.

    text: 'Brilliant I.D. Chris, and thanks David for pointing out the importance of the leaves. Although I couldn''t find the affected plant; the Snow Daisy Bush is well-represented in the area with lots of young ones. The leaves and stem appear identical. '
