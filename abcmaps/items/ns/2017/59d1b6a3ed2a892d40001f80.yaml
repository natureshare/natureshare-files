description: Possibly the Holey Plains Form as it was observed adjacent to the Holey Plains State Park. VicFlora has this form with narrower leaves (to 5mm) and less hairy flowers than other forms of G.chrysophaea. I did not measure the leaves but they appeared to be a little larger than as stated; perhaps to 1cm.
