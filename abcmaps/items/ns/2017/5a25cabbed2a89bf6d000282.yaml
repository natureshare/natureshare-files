    text: 'Very nice find Luke. Was expecting more obvious fimbriate petals, but perhaps other characters point you to this taxa. Were the plants rather tall? How wide were the leaves?'

    text: 'Chris, after going over the I.D. info again I can''t positively say that it is Arthropodium sp. 1 - robust glaucous. It could be A. milleflorum. I have therefore put it under Arthropodium spp. for the time being. Is that O.K.?'

    text: This is up to you. I  not familiar with the taller glaucous version and it may well be it. Other photos i have seen show more fimbriate petals. Location is good though.
