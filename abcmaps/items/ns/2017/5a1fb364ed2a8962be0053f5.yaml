description: Growing on a flank of Mount Stirling at about 1300m altitude. Dianella tasmanica is a common species in the area but this one seems to have a thicker flower stem and more closely clustered flowers. Three photos.

    text: "Thanks Lorraine. I'm still not sure with your I.D. I have photographed several  S. glauca and none exhibit the traits of this one. I am more inclined to think that it is a Dianella species and after spending time comparing the different Dianella members, I can only come to the conclusion that it is a very healthy and vigorous D. tasmanica. \r\nPlease see the third image uploaded in this set for the typical Dianella basal leaf structure which varies quite a bit to Stypandra; which has only sparse leaves around the base. \r\nThe habitat (sheltered, damp forest) and 1300m elevation also do not match S. glauca's preference. \r\nI have added a fourth image which shows the serrated margin of the leaves as highlighted by VicFlora for D. tasminica (see the lower leaf on the extra image). \r\n"

    text: I agree. It's a great way to get out and experience nature at it's best. I'm often envious of your wonderful photos.
