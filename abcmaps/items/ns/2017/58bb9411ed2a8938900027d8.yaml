    text: 'Well spotted. As you say, rarely recored in Victoria. An interesting plant (a bladderwort) that is said to capture organisms in its bladders.'

    text: ALA has a record in the area from 2007 but that was about 5km in a direct line from this sighting. These photos are from 2016. It should be flowering again in the next week or so. I will be keen to go back and check them out again and see if there are any more likely dams in the area.
