description: 'Need an I.D. please. On Dargo High Plains altitude 1500m about 5km from the Sedum Acre posted yesterday. Looks similar but could be a Ranunculus species. Very hairy stems and what seem to be the leaves. Flowering early December. This one was growing in a wet area. Suggestions have been Ranunculus collinus, Ranunculus amplus or another Sedum species. Can anyone help please? Thank you.'

    text: 'Definitely Ranunculus and appearance consistent with Ranunculus pimpinellifolius. See http://bie.ala.org.au/species/http://id.biodiversity.org.au/node/apni/2916607#overview. The petals in your specimen seem narrower but this could be shrivelling if it was a hot day or intraspecific variation. As always, can never be certain from photographs only. Habit, location and habitat fit.'
