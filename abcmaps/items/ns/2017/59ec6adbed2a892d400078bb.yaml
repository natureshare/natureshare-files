    text: Thanks Cathy. I'm glad you said that. I was just about to delete with the thinking that it was a bit sub-standard but conveniently lost internet connection just as was about to press delete. It was a real thrill. Pity the sound didn't come out as it should have. I was in full view of them but they took no notice.
