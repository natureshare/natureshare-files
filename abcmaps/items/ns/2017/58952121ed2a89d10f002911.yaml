    text: Maybe Olearia aff. Ramulosa (Omeo). Vicflora says found at Omeo and Licola 700m - 1400m. This one was definitely a bit higher at 1600m.

    text: 'Doesn''t look like Olearia ramulosa or even Olearia. The Daisy family is huge and difficult. Identification often relies on microscopic examination to nail it. The fine detail of the stems and leaves are often more important than the flower. Are you able to get an extreme close-up of the stem, leaf and base of the flower-head? Someone who is familiar with the species may be able to suggest the id from the general appearance.'

    text: Thanks David. These are the only images I have. I have deleted the suggested ID. I hope that deletes it from the record image.

    text: Those new images are looking a bit more like O. ramulosa so maybe your are right.

    text: 'It looks close enough to be match, so I think you should restore your original id. (Olearia aff. ramulosa (Omeo). This is a rare plant and a great observation! Sorry for the confusion.'

    text: Thanks again David. Being just an amateur wildflower sleuth I am never completely sure of my opinion. On this occasion I spent a good two or more hours looking through all the reference sites and changed my mind several times. Am finding it a fascinating hobby though. I was thrilled when I saw this species confirmed by ALA as existing almost exactly where I saw it.
