    text: 'Hi Janine, the files you are uploading are too small for ID purposes. Note on the photo upload page of NatureShare we ask for 1-3Mb files if possible, and 3 photos per observation rather than multiple observations might help ID too. Note you can delete photos from an existing observation and replace them with larger files. Feel free to email me if you have questions. russellbest@riddellscreeklandcare.org.au'

    text: Based on plant distributions alone (not a good way to ID) it seems Westringia glabra is the likely possibility at that location.
