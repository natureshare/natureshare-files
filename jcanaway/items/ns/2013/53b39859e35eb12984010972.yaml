    text: 'You took me back to see this plant so I have some pics of it too. Petals are usually wider and white (occasionally pale blue) but it is S. albida. The flowers are sessile, this was in flower in October and it is rising through other plants - all features of S. albida. It is close to S. hookeri for which flowers aren''t sessile, flowers usually start in Nov and it is prostrate/mat forming.'
