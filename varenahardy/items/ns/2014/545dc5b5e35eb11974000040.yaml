    text: 'Hi Verena. I think this might be C. gracilis but I can''t be absolutely sure from the photos. Do you have other pics at different angle? Also, is it possible to add location via the interactive map? The three bits of info that make an observation truly useful are name, date, location.'

    text: 'Have added a third picture, but unfortunately I didn''t take a picture with a size comparison. I thought it was bigger than C.gracilis which I think I also saw & will post shortly. Thanks for you''re input much appreciated, just learning my way around this this site.'
