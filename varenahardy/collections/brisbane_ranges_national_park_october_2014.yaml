title: Brisbane Ranges National Park October 2014
description: 'Returning to the Ballarat side of Victoria these are photos of my trips to the Brisbane Ranges National Park through October & November. It has been very dry there, so I''m told, & the variety of orchids seen wasn''t as good as previous years (that''s what the locals told me). '
