    text: 'Hi Peter. Appears to be a chenopod of the prickly variety. Difficult to see the leaves clearly to make identification. Form appears like Salsola, but would then be very large plants for this species. Worth comparing against Sclerolaena species also. If you are able to provide a close-up of the branches (with leaves and fruit), this would help enormously.'
