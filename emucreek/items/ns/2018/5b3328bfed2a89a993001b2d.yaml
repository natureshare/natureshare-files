    text: 'This is Mycena clarkeana, you can see white spores deposited on some caps from the cap above and also see the standard pink colouration of this species in the more sheltered parts of the group. It is an hygrophanous species which fades to buff/white when dry like this group.There is part of an upturned cap on the bottom right which gives you a look at the gills (as does the part eaten cap in the third image). The real giveaway to its identity however is the shape of the caps which are classical Mycena clarkeana.'
