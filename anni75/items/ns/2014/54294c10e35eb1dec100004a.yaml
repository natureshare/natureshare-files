    text: 'Not at all. It might be D. phylicoides. It has spiralled leaves and your pic shows some spiralled and some not. On the other hand, the flowers are supposed to be terminal, or nearly so, in phylicoides whereas yours shows flowers that axillary and all along the stem. I''ll look into some more. I was just wondering how you got to D. phylicoides, which isn''t a widely known species.'

    text: 'I believe it is common to Broadford and Mt Piper in particular - but please don''t quote me as I am pretty new to this game. The Broadford Land Management group is putting together a brochure and it is included. I am going to the Colin Officer Flora reserve walk this weekend, so will ask for more information when I''m there. '
