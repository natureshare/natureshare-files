    text: 'Hi Russell. Not a black swan, but a domestic Pilgrim goose - which is why I left her out of the observation record. They coexist with the wild birds quite happily. We do see black swan here occasionally later in Spring, but they are only passing through and don''t stay to breed. There is some larger water nearby where swan do spend extended periods.'
