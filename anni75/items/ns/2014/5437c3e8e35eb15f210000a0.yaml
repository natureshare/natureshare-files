    text: 'This is certainly Pisolithus, but there are a number of native species, that can be difficult to tell apart. Pisolithus arihzus is a northern hemisphere species that does not occur in Australia, although the name, along with Pisolithus tinctorius, has been applied incorrectly to Australian material in the past.'
