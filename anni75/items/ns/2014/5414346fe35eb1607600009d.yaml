    text: 'This looks interesting. Can you measure the length of the leaves (greater or less than 40cm), and tell me if the edges of the top of the leaf are serrated (edges rough rather than smooth)? The flower and time of flowering looks like Dianella amoena (EPBC protected).'

    text: Hi Russell. I have only seen this once on the property. Its an older photo from Christmas last year. I know roughly where it was and I can keep the area ungrazed in the hope it pops up again. To be honest - I wouldn't know what to look for without the flower. Sorry I can't offer any more information immediately.
