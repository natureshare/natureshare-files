    text: 'I think these beetles are of the family Tenebrionidae and are probably Adelium spp.  If you look on Natureshare, in my collection of Invertebrates, under Species, and click on Adelium spp, there are 3 observations there.  We have come across these beetles in numbers at times.  - See if you think they are these are the same.  (I did try just clicking on ''Search'' (on the opening page of Natureshare) for ''Adelium spp.'', but didn''t find any of my photos there - maybe I just didn''t work it right!)  '
