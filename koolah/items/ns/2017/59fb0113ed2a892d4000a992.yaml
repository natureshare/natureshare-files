description: "Comments from Martin Lagerwey:  one nymph molting, the emerging nymph will be second instar and is entirely red for a few hours till its black markings appear.  This group is a stink bug.\_ I think it is the predatory stink bug based on the 'eyelashes' seen on the eggs.  Two photos included with this observation."
