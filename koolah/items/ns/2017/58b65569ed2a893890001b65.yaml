description: "Thanks to Martin Lagerwey for ID confirmation.  His comments:   Mainly Victorian beetle is nocturnal and each observation that I have made was under bark.\_ Light trapping is a good way to encounter one.\_ The color of the eight dots can be red or orange or yellow but otherwise they do not vary much."
