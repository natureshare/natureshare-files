    text: 'Yes but idea is in chemical that they contains: some mixture of quinols and alcohols.  In some sort of farms (reactors with ideal condition) they can be  grown intensively. At the and it will be more cost effective then any process of synthesis. Similarly  many chemicals are now produced by bacteria (It is much worst, becouse bacteria are genetically modified !!!). I very do not like all that industrial/technology staff-particularly genetically modified organisms. Purple Jellydisc is naturally very effective and do not need modification. If final product is beneficial for the biosphere, Why not.  '
