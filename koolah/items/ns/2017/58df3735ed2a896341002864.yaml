    text: 'From a number of the frames, you can clearly make out the long tail. This could indicate a freetail bat (Mormopterus spp.) Also seems to be a large microbat.'

    text: 'From the fluttery flight, broad wings and large ears I''d suggest this is much more likely to be a long-eared bat (Nyctophilus sp). Little freetails are nowhere near as maneuverable as that and have much narrower wings - the tip of the tail would be free, but this one is fully enclosed in the tail membrane.'

    text: Not enough resolution to suggest whether N. geoffroyi or N. gouldi.  Both are possible in or near the Brisbane Ranges.

    text: Thank you Chris and Lawrie.  Your comments certainly made me look closer at the video.
