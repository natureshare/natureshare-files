    text: 'It seems to have a pronounced brow, thick legs and a round-ish tail so I would think Brown Goshawk fits best, but not certain. Perhaps posting images on the facebook Australian Bird Identification group would get a more confident ID.'

    text: Andrew-I thought that might be the ID.  Looks like a juvenile.  Excited to have it spend the time at the water tub.
