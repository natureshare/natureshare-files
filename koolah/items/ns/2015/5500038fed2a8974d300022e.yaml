    text: "Hello Cathy.\r\nI have seen these gorgeous beetles many times in Melbourne.  \r\nThere are three common species which look similar and you can see them all here; http://www.bowerbird.org.au/users/1955/sightings?query=gloriosa or here https://sites.google.com/site/paropsisternapages/paropsisterna-x5 \r\nI have spent hours reading the keys to these species (Blackburn1899)  and am confident to separate them visually\r\nI believe that yours is Paropsisterna annularis which has a slightly different pattern to P. gloriosa.  There are four more (two pairs of) dots behind the central pair of yellow dots but not easily visible in your photo.     You can see them more clearly here because I picked the light angle lights them up.    http://natureshare.org.au/observations/54ede47ced2a8927710000fe?species=Paropsisterna+annularis&tag= .\r\nAlso, the two yellow dots on the centre are elongated in gloriosa and touch, or nearly touch the lateral vitta (yellow stripe along the side) at its second (posterior) bump.   These are the two consistent differences.  \r\n\r\n"
