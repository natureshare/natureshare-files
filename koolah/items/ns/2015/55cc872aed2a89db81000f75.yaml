    text: 'I had to delete your ''flower-yellow'' tag as the pics don''t show a yellow flower. If you want to add the info that this plant has a yellow flower when in flower then this is a species ''identification feature'' which can be added by editing the species info. As it happens, flower: yellow is already there for this species. This means a search in your Brisbane Range collection for plants with yellow flowers will already have this species in the search result.
