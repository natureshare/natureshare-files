    text: 'Wondering if you confirmed this was scandens by hairy fruit or hairy ovary? Flower looks a bit like B. mutabilis, or scandens s.l. if it can''t be confirmed?'

    text: Did I ever mention how much frustration I feel when it comes to plant ID?  I have changed the species name after investigating and finding that the name has been changed from B. scandens var scandens to B. mutabilis.  Thanks for helping me to get this right.
