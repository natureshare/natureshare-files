description: 'The ID created a challenge.  Males of this species, as featured in MOV 2 shows a white tuft end to the abdomen.  This one has an orange colour tuft as well as a black upper body and stripes on the underside of the body.  May eventually be found to be a different species.  It got knocked off the sheet by a larger insect and played dead long enough to get a photo of the underside.  Two additional images included to show the features.'
