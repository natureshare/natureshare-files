description: 'This species comes to the light readily however only once in the past has it landed on the sheet.  Invariably it sits on the ground using the stones and leave litter as camouflage.  This image was not posed but rather an opportunistic observation which portrays the similarity of the leaf to the moth wing shape, colour and markings.'
