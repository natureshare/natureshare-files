  Spider found in the northern part of the Brisbane Ranges
  Identified as Araneus eburnus on <a href="http://www.bowerbird.org.au/observations/49129">Bowerbird</a> by Liz O'Donnell: "Hi Cathy - Suggest this is eburnis not cyphoxis as cyphoxis is a western species, the two species overlap in SA not Victoria. Cheers, Liz"
