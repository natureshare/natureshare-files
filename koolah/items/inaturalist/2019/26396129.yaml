description: "? Noctuidae\r\nIdentified as Noctuidae on <a href=\"http://www.bowerbird.org.au/observations/32620\">Bowerbird</a> by Ken Walker: \"Cathy -- This one has stumped all of the local and Canberra experts.  Here is what Ted Edwards has to offer: \"It looks as though it is a male but I cannot be certain.  If it is a male it will be in the Hadenini, related to Persectania and some similar species.  It is possible it is an odd Agrotis in the Noctuini in which case it would have to be a female as the male should have clearly visible pectinate antennae.  The definitive test between these two would be whether it has hairy eyes or not.  But the photo loses definition before I can tell if it has hairy eyes.  I do not think there is any doubt that it is in one or other of the two tribes.\"  Better get out the setting box and collect a few specimens.\""
