    text: "Poecilasthena certainly looks good but there are so many options. I like P pulchraria hind wing angles but the fringes look a bit rich for this one. Working through MoV3 CD but I note the warning on page 33. It might stay at genus. Comments welcome and thanks again.\r\n"

    text: The nearest I can find is the third pic on MoV3 CD Poecilasthena sp(2)2.pdf - the fringe is almost non-existent and the size is right too.

    text: Mark - I still am leaning towards P pulchraria because of the dashes on the right upper wing termen and also the sp(2) has a cream edge with darkish fringe.  The fringe may be worn away.

    text: ID changed. Please thank Marilyn for me. So many micro-leps around at the moment. I guess they are even less described.
