description: 'These were low growing from two oval shaped leaves up to about 70mm above the ground and about 40mm wide. Roughly half a dozen calli occur in the rear part of the labellum plus a single taller stalked callus standing in the back. The calli decrease in size to the front. The orchids dupe male Thynnus sp. (flower wasps) by producing the ''scent'' of a female wasp. The flower has a large labellum including a group of dark, shiny calli (stemmed knobs and buttons) with a particular ''insectiform'' arrangement. The broader callus at the centre is what the male wasp grasps at causing the labellum to collapse upwards. The waspâ€™s thorax is then coated with pollen as it fights it''s way out. '
