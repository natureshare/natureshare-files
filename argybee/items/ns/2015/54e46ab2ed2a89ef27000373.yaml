description: "Approximately 15mm overall this weird spider didn't move like most. It was slow, turning constantly, waving two pairs of fore legs very slowly, and definitely attracted to my torch light. Strong patterns of cream, black, brown and quite tubercular in parts. Short abdomen and large flattened cephalo-thorax. I think I can see eight eyes but tiny and well dispersed. \r\nSlowly exploring a wall in a very dark area of the local school late at night."
