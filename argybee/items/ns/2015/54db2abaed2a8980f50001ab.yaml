description: "A small clerid beetle moving and marked like an ant. About 12mm long.  Dark red antennae and legs. Cleridae, Clerinae, Scrobiger seems most likely and this is not the one with yellow antennae.\r\nThis might be the target of mimicry found in the same area http://natureshare.org.au/observations/54f7c4c3ed2a89097e00027d"

    text: Amazing Mark. Fantastic example of deception. My first impression was it looks a bit like a Jumping Jack but it is much more like Rhytidoponera metallica? Do you think the white markings are to make the abdomen look more segmented like an ant?

    text: 'I meant to mention too ... Red legs and red antennae match too, as in this observation: http://natureshare.org.au/observations/53b39856e35eb1298400fe41  The bead-like antennae are a pretty good match too.'

    text: 'Yep that ant looks a good mimic target. This beetle is just over the back of our hill so I''m determined to find the exact ant species in the same location. (and maybe a clerid with 2 antennae :)'

    text: Good luck looking for Rhytidoponera metallica. I've seen it at a few locations that I visit regularly and at each spot I've only ever seen it once!

    text: 'My goodness Rhytidoponera metallica is very similar. Thanks Russell that will help in the search. The annoying thing is that I saw many similar ants on the day but only did the beetle. '

    text: Sorry Russell I didn't comment re white markings... yes I'm certainly those markings are too much in exactly the right place to not suggest proportional body segments - all you can logically do with an essential pair of wing covers I guess. The proportions are excellent match to Rhytidoponera metallica.
