description: "Not really dead at all - these clean looking moths make it simple to get underneath shots by remaining completely still for up to a minute if upturned. About 40mm long, mostly white with many dark spots and a striking flash of vermilion around the thorax. Attracted to powerful night lights above a car at a national park.\r\nOne of the few species I have found whose larvae can feed on Tradescantia which has become a noxious weed around here. Go mothy !!"

    text: 'Ha! Yes one thing that has amazed me about moths is the way the different families react very differently to local disturbances. It''s actually handy to know when approaching one with a big fat scary camera. :)'
