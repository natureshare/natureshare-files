description: Very often we find eucalyptus leaves that have been delaminated and puffed into a 'pillow' with a large internal void. This tiny wasp might be part of the story. It was at a rough opening on this puffed leaf and seems to be extricating itself from a skin just inside the hole. About 6mm long with distinctive black pterostigma and a longish flexed abdomen.. It turns out that this is a type of sawfly. Black over the thorax should be Phylacteophaga froggatti (male)
