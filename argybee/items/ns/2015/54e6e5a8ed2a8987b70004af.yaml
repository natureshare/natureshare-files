description: "A small notodontid moth with big fur. About 30mm long.\r\nAttracted to lights at night at the local primary school.\r\n\"There is a range of wing colours of adult Trichiocercus sparshalli. Most are white, but specimens can be obtained from a light grey to a dark grey. Peter Marriott has reported seeing specimens from many places in Victoria from October to May, but there seems to be no time relationship between colour variations. Those from Mt. Martha on the Mornington Peninsula appear to be always white, but those from Ballarat and Kallista have the full range of colours. They all have a balding brown head having black hair. They have a wingspan of about 4 cms.\" - LepidopteraButterflyHouse"
