description: "About 35mm wide and 40mm tall. The under view revealed the last few net-like remains of the cortina still clinging on to the stipe..  In an open, dry sclerophyll eucalyptus based forest. Cardinia nature reserve. \r\nPossibly C archeri but the stipe is not common"

    text: 'This was originally id as Cortinarius archeri, but this is more robust and would have a slimy partial veil and quite slimy pileus and stipe surface. There are quite a few purple species of Cortinarius.'
