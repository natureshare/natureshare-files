description: "About 15mm long. Very dark red elytra with bright red margins and tiny spots of white all over. The rest of the bug is an almost iridescent pink red. Resting under light on a stone wall in an outer urban back yard. This is a particularly dark specimen. They are also called 'Red fungus bug'. Also accidentally introduced to the northern parts of New Zealand although there is a theory that they may have been 'blown' over there by prevailing weather patterns. \r\norder: HEMIPTERA \r\nsuborder: AUCHENORRHYNCHA \r\ninfraorder: FULGOROMORPHA \r\nsuperfamily: FULGOROIDEA \r\nfamily: ACHILIDAE \r\nsubfamily: Achilinae \r\ntribe: Achilini "
