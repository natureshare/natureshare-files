    text: 'One of my favourite orchids. An amazing feat of evolution. Surprisingly missing from the Macedon Range with only only record from a century ago nearby by George Lyell, in the Lerderderg area - which a walker friend stumbled across again a couple of years ago - a tiny patch of just a few plants, off track in the middle of nowhere! I see lots down Mallacoota way.'
