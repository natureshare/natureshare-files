    text: 'Yes they are weird animals. They are amazing to watch when attacking other creatures being surprisingly fast and overcoming them with speed, strength and sticky, digestive mucous. They then evert a muscular pharynx to consume the prey. Little nightmares for small critters but an important indicator of local bio conditions as they need clean moisture. These and the blue one I posted are now travelling the world successfully as are the ''hammerhead'' types out of Asia.'
