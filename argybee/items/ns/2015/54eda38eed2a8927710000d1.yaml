description: "This plant was all alone on a rocky hillside but looked very healthy. The whole 'bush' was about one metre tall and 1.5 across. It is a climbing, clambering trailing type with clusters of purple, violet, pink or white flowers each about 15mm max. across. Surely it wasn't planted in that location.\r\nIn a nature reserve next to a dam wall.\r\n"
