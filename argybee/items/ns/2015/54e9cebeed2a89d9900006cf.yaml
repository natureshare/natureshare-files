description: "Brackets of up to 30mm wide. Very distinctive yellow gills with much crossing, meandering and very much darker towards the centre. Thin and leathery caps with a very dull ochre top. Caps seem to curl into wavy shapes as they get older.\r\nThese numbered about a dozen in a line on the side of a huge Pinus radiata log with Wicks nature reserve. These logs were placed in the area for landscaping purposes.\r\nID as in Fuhrer (2005) #281 \r\nRarely found yet in Australia? and seemingly uncommon elsewhere. The best reference images I can find are with Ren√©e Lebeuf from Quebec. \r\n\r\n(need to add ' Pseudomerulius curtisii ')  \r\n"
