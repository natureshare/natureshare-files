description: "Not expecting to see moths at this time of year, especially out in the open like this one, I almost trod on it. Imitating a dead leaf it was so convinced of it's strategy it refused to flinch when I touched it. About 45mm across.\r\nIn an open area of short grasses within a dry eucalyptus woodland. Churchill National park."
