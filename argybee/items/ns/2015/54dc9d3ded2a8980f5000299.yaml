description: 'An oval shaped open-weave cocoon made from the hairs of a very hairy caterpillar. After the wingless female moth has pupated she emerged to lay her tiny, pearly eggs all over the matrix. The remains of the pupal sheath can be seen within the cocoon. The whole structure is about 25mm long. The last pic is 2 days later and shows her up on the cage, face down, abdomen up. The abdomen was slowly waving in the air.'
