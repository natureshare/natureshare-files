description: "A small (5mm) weevil which has created a nidus. The relationships here are extraordinary. The female weevil steps out a measure of leaf, cuts it, folds and rolls it smearing a mystery substance as she goes, and injecting spores of a penicillin fungus she had collected in thoracic cavities. The peniciliin protects the larvae as they develop from other infections but don't provide nourishment.\r\nFamily Attelabidae; Genus Euops: need to add these"
