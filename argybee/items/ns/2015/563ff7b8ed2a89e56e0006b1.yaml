description: 'This is not Platystomatidae according to Tony from Tasmania " Likely a Rivellia species (we have very similar looking in Tasmania), though would need a closer view of the wing venation to be more certain. (No Pogonortalis have a wing pattern like this.) " The only other images I can find of this one are from Suzanne Jones http://natureshare.org.au/observations/53df1765e35eb16d3d000006 and also here http://www.bowerbird.org.au/observations/19369 '
