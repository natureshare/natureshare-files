description: '2-3mm long this spider displayed some strange behaviours. When running it was so fast I was sure it must be jumping or flying. When it stopped it always buried it''s head into a tiny depression, raised it''s abdomen and wrapped it''s front legs over the other pairs and around the sides of it''s abdomen. It would then hold that position for many minutes. '
