description: "This slime mold has developed miniature, upside down ropey 'trees' each about 3-4mm tall with a clump of yellow fuzz for the 'leaves'. Previously the yellow fuzzy parts were contained in a plasticky, smooth, tan coloured capsule which popped it's top off for the fuzz to puff out. Some of the old caps can be seen still lying around. \r\n"

    text: Yes it makes me wish I had some real camera equipment instead of a little pocket cam but it's enough to learn. Love your collection of observations btw. I'll have to go through them slowly soon.
