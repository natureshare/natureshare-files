description: "In moss and growing to about 30mm tall and 18mm wide. Radial texture with a relatively deep central depression on the cap. Very sparse and simple gills same colour as cap. Mycelia showing at the foot.\r\nNext to a walking track in a nature reserve. Cardinia.\r\n\"It is thought by some mycologists that it is likely Omphalina chromacea may be the fungal component of a lichen (a symbiosis between an alga and a fungus). The alga is most likely Coccomyxa.\" Australian Fungi Blogspot"
