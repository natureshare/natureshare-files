description: 'Plush moth about 28mm across wings back. A line of dark spots near outer margin. Dark areas on costa near base. Deep orange-red colour particularly near head and thorax. Antennae highly plumose black on white.  "Pterolocera rubescens is a possibility but work needs to be done to determine the Victorian species (of which there are three as yet un-named)" - thanks Peter Marriott '
