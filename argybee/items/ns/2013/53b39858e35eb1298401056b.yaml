    text: 'All kingdoms. NS is for Vic species only but there aren''t good Vic lists for many groups, including spiders, beetles, fungi, etc but working on those. If you find a species name isn''t on NS let me know and I will upload the name. Sources for Vic data in NS is available at https://sites.google.com/site/naturesharehelp/acknowledgements'
