    text: Thanks Russell. I should have put it back to Hersiliidae. I thought the system was insisting on species level ID. You're so right about not many such finds even in Victoria. We've seen a couple of different looking ones over the past 2 years... possibly one species though. They might vary with growth.

    text: 'No worries. NS is for Vic species only but there aren''t good Vic lists for many groups, including spiders, beetles, fungi, etc but working on those. If you find a species name isn''t on NS let me know and I will upload the name.'
