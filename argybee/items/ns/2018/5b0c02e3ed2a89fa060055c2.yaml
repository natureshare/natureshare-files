description: "Found on a broad sandy beach facing the Southern ocean this very firm, moist, velvety dark green ball was washed up. \r\nI have seen them before but never thought much about them. \r\nA bit larger than a golf ball, very slightly translucent, very dense like it was full of water, tough yet velvety.\r\n\r\nChlorophyta : Bryopsidophyceae : Bryopsidales : Codiaceae \r\nApparently they can be up to 120mm dia. and are composed of a single cell which can repair itself if damaged. \r\nIt appears fluffy underwater.\r\n"

    text: Yes it actually looked a little greener than this. My cam at the time hated greens.
