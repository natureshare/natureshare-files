description: "This creature had just been left among the detritus at high-tide mark as the water began to recede. \r\nIt seemed that it was beginning to dry out in the sand.\r\n150mm long and about 60mm diameter, cylindrical but tapered both ends; very small 'mouth' opening at one end; pale cream coloured to pale orange at the 'head' end; felt very firm but dry to touch; some minor wrinkles covering most of the body (could be from beginning to dry out?) These might be the most non-descript creatures I can think of - ventral, dorsal, lateral views almost indistinguishable!"

    text: A strange-looking creature related to the sea-urchins but without the spiny skin. Has radial symmetry which makes it different to the higher animals which have bilateral symmetry. Nice observation!

    text: Thanks. It seemed to exist in a whole different time-frame to us. Ever so slowly flexed it's body while I carried it back to water. Yes very strange things.
