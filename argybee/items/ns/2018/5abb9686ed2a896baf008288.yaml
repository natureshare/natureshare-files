description: "Found at low tide in a rocky channel this egg-case was well attached by the tendril at one end to something below a covering of sand.\r\nAlso known as Swellshark or Draughtboard shark. The case was about 250mm long, squared at one end and tapered to a point at the other. Each end had two long, curly tendrils. The shark is a benthic zone species native to Australian waters. A very similar and related species is found in New Zealand.\r\n"
