description: "Many of these were found on small rocky areas near an ocean beach at low tide. \r\nAbout 20mm diameter, mostly matte black.\r\nOcean/bay beach on a small patch of sedimentary rocks.\r\nNo operculum was found nor live specimens so species ID is difficult."

    text: 'Hi David. I just chatted with Audrey Falconer and Simon Grove who treat them as two species. Unfortunately my pic doesn''t have the information to distinguish - an operculum with either black or brown colouration. :-) Can I therefore ask a favour to add Nerita sp. - thanks.'
