description: "These were growing in a small nature reserve on a rocky shoreline just inside the mouth of WesternPort.\r\nGreenish brown-algae made of strings of hollow, water-filled, round beads on a short stalk. Each bead has a smooth surface except for an even array of tiny tubercules (containing reproductive cells) and is about 12-15mm diameter. The strings might be up to 200mm long and many strings may grow from a single base.\r\nSometimes called sea grapes.\r\n"
