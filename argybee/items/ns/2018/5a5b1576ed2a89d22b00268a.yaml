description: "Small green and white spider (about 9mm body) settled into a fold on acacia leaves (A dealbata?) \r\nDistinctive spiky 'shoulders'.\r\nIt seems this one might be undescribed.. David Akers, Reiner Richter and Nick Monaghan have posted it on BowerBird and elsewhere. Nick might have it wrongly named it with Araneus psittacinus complex. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.bowerbird.org.au/observations/102135\r\nhttp://www.bowerbird.org.au/observations/102132\r\n\r\nAraneidae anyway...
