description: "This little patch of lichen was on rocks just above the high tide mark. \r\nIt would have been getting full sun for most of the day and in spite of it's soft fluid appearance it was really quite tough. \r\nIt was surrounded by other lichens, one that looked like splattered white paint and one which was very black and even tougher.\r\nAbout 50mm across.\r\n\r\nMaybe Caloplaca thallincola ??"
