It initially landed on it's back revealing similar colours but with 2 darker grey areas near the centre of the wings. Even when touched it refused to attempt flight and would just flip over to lie still on top of the other leaves. ",

Roughly half a dozen calli occur in the rear part of the labellum plus a single taller stalked callus standing in the back. The calli decrease in size to the front. The orchids dupe male Thynnus sp. (flower wasps) by producing the 'scent' of a female wasp. The flower has a large labellum including a group of dark, shiny calli (stemmed knobs and buttons) with a particular 'insectiform' arrangement. The broader callus at the centre is what the male wasp grasps at causing the labellum to collapse upwards. The wasp’s thorax is then coated with pollen as it fights it's way out. ",
