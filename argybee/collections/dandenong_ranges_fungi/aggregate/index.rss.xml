      <description>Caps of this bright orange mushroom were no more than 10 mm with a deep central depression. Younger fruiting bodies were almost hemispherical, flattening out as the mature. Caps showed some striation and margins were wavy. &#xD;
Stipe was smooth and slightly paler than the cap.  Could not get a shot of the gills. Possibly Rickenella fibula.</description>

      <description>Poking out of the ground to about 90 mm were a number of these black club-shaped fruiting bodies. Structurally they were differentiated into black clubs above and pale greenish yellow stems below. The older thicker clubs had white fluffy material on the dark clubs.&#xD;
Spotted under a mature Acacia tree. There were about 20 and all well separated.&#xD;
The white material on the fruiting bodies are thread-like spores. They break up into 3 -5 mm long part spores which penetrate the ground and infect caterpillars of moths which could be well below the surface, even up to 40 cms. The fungus consumes the soft tissue of the host and grows up wards to the ground surface were black fruiting bodies appear and thicken to maturity. Moth larvae of the genus Oxycanus ( Hepialidae) are said to be the common hosts to this fungus. &#xD;

      <description>Pic 1 shows the underside of the cap of this thick white fungus. The fertile surface showed closely packed white "teeth" instead of gills or pores. The teeth were decurrent ( running down the stem) -pic 4. The young fruiting bodies were growing in a clump with some of their thick white stipes fused together. The caps were a pale orange, distorted by mutual pressure and showed in-rolled margins. The stem turned a beautiful orange when bruised or cut.&#xD;
Growing on a damp eucalyptus forest floor, among leaf and wood debris.&#xD;

      <description>Brackets of up to 30mm wide. Very distinctive yellow gills with much crossing, meandering and very much darker towards the centre. Thin and leathery caps with a very dull ochre top. Caps seem to curl into wavy shapes as they get older.&#xD;
These numbered about a dozen in a line on the side of a huge Pinus radiata log with Wicks nature reserve. These logs were placed in the area for landscaping purposes.&#xD;
ID as in Fuhrer (2005) #281 &#xD;
Rarely found yet in Australia? and seemingly uncommon elsewhere. The best reference images I can find are with Renée Lebeuf from Quebec. &#xD;

      <description>Patches of lemon yellow tissue about 1-2mm thick, on bare, dead, barkless nothofagus trunk. Tiny dark spots (ostioles) from which ascospores are released.&#xD;
In a tall rain forest national park.&#xD;
This was previously called H sulphurea, the northern hemisphere version but recent work has proven it to be a different species. A wood-rotting ascomycete, which might also colonize some other fungi. </description>

      <description>From above they look like little brains attached to a thin stick. From below they reveal a crazy maze of crossed and meandering gills. The largest of the group was about 40mm wide and there were about a dozen caps in total.&#xD;
