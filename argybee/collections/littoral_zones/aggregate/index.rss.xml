      <description>Found trapped in a small pool of seawater at low tide on rocks.&#xD;
These are very fast and always keen to remain in shadows. &#xD;
About 9mm long; others in the area suggest high variability in colour and pattern.&#xD;
Sphaeromatid isopod... </description>

      <description>Ground covering clambering winding to 600mm high; strings and clusters of small yellow flowers (new) and papery white+brown calyces. Found in very sandy soil just 'above' high tide level - a foreshore with mangroves.&#xD;
Threatened species. Very attractive en-masse. &#xD;
Native to the south-east coast of Australia including Tasmania inhabiting salty marshes and mud flats. &#xD;
Family: Plumbaginaceae &#xD;
Common Names: Yellow Sea Lavender </description>

      <description>Found on a broad sandy beach facing the Southern ocean this very firm, moist, velvety dark green ball was washed up. &#xD;
I have seen them before but never thought much about them. &#xD;
A bit larger than a golf ball, very slightly translucent, very dense like it was full of water, tough yet velvety.&#xD;
&#xD;
Chlorophyta : Bryopsidophyceae : Bryopsidales : Codiaceae &#xD;
Apparently they can be up to 120mm dia. and are composed of a single cell which can repair itself if damaged. &#xD;
It appears fluffy underwater.&#xD;

      <description>This little patch of lichen was on rocks just above the high tide mark. &#xD;
It would have been getting full sun for most of the day and in spite of it's soft fluid appearance it was really quite tough. &#xD;
It was surrounded by other lichens, one that looked like splattered white paint and one which was very black and even tougher.&#xD;
About 50mm across.&#xD;
&#xD;
Maybe Caloplaca thallincola ??</description>

      <description>These were growing in a small nature reserve on a rocky shoreline just inside the mouth of WesternPort.&#xD;
Greenish brown-algae made of strings of hollow, water-filled, round beads on a short stalk. Each bead has a smooth surface except for an even array of tiny tubercules (containing reproductive cells) and is about 12-15mm diameter. The strings might be up to 200mm long and many strings may grow from a single base.&#xD;
Sometimes called sea grapes.&#xD;

      <description>This creature had just been left among the detritus at high-tide mark as the water began to recede. &#xD;
It seemed that it was beginning to dry out in the sand.&#xD;
150mm long and about 60mm diameter, cylindrical but tapered both ends; very small 'mouth' opening at one end; pale cream coloured to pale orange at the 'head' end; felt very firm but dry to touch; some minor wrinkles covering most of the body (could be from beginning to dry out?) These might be the most non-descript creatures I can think of - ventral, dorsal, lateral views almost indistinguishable!</description>

      <description>Many of these were found on small rocky areas near an ocean beach at low tide. &#xD;
About 20mm diameter, mostly matte black.&#xD;
Ocean/bay beach on a small patch of sedimentary rocks.&#xD;
No operculum was found nor live specimens so species ID is difficult.</description>

      <description>Thousands of these small plants were being flushed through the tiny, intertidal channels. They had a sharp, tought, spiny foot which was superb for latching onto rocks and sand. Some would then work their way into the sand as the water pulsed them back and forth. Each was about 60mm long.&#xD;
Sublittoral zone, near the mouth of a large open bay. The bay is generally very shallow with clean sand floor but receives a decent flush of southern ocean water via some very deep channels.</description>

      <description>This small fungus was found in sand just inside the mouth of the Snowy River. &#xD;
It might have developed from some other buried substrate but the nearest plant life was a few metres away. &#xD;
Viscid, mildly conical, mustard yellow cap, gills free, spore possibly brown (see pic 2). About 16mm across &#xD;
About 30mm tall.&#xD;
Resembling a yellow version of Mycena interupta.</description>

      <description>These three Pied Oyster Catchers were working the wet sand on the shoreline searching for food items. &#xD;
The gulls were following and watching closely for ideas or morsels that might escape the OCs.&#xD;
Quite a team.</description>

      <description>Found at low tide in a rocky channel this egg-case was well attached by the tendril at one end to something below a covering of sand.&#xD;
Also known as Swellshark or Draughtboard shark. The case was about 250mm long, squared at one end and tapered to a point at the other. Each end had two long, curly tendrils. The shark is a benthic zone species native to Australian waters. A very similar and related species is found in New Zealand.&#xD;
