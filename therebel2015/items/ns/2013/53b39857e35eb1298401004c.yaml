    text: Looks like Chrysomelidae spp. but Coleoptera spp. best until more sure.

    text: This leaf beetle is Paropsisterna sp.  They appear like ladybird beetles to protect from ants who like to peck at their antennae and toes.  Both beetle families can tuck them away tightly and continue their habitation of foliage.  I have not yet determined the species name and thisseems to be one of this genus that is very hard to identify
