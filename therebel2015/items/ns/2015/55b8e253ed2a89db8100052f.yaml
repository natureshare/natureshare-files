    text: 'Difficult for me to be confident about the identification without knowing the location and not having the detail in the photo. The bright sunlight on the bark makes it look brighter than it possibly is and the upper branches appear smooth, so possibly I am wrong to suggest E. radiata. Worth a re-visit when you''re in the area next.'
