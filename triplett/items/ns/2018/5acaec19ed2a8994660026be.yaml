description: 'Seems to be feeding on a Yellow Box leaf. After wading through 500+ Pentatomidae photos on Bowerbird the only match I could find was http://www.bowerbird.org.au/observations/88269. According to the post Acanthosomatidae differs from Pentatomidae in having 2 instead of 3 tarsal segments but I don''t think you can see that in my crappy photo.'

    text: 'Looks to be a good match with the BB obs, identified by Tony D. I''ve added to the classification details. A good find - only the second "Parent bug" on NatureShare.'
