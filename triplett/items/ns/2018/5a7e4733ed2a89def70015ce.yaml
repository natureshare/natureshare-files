description: 'Looks the same as caterpillar photos previously posted (eg https://natureshare.org.au/observations/59fd5553ed2a892d4000afd7?species=Acyphas+spp.&tag=) so I have not tried to id. Previous photos were on eucalyptus, and I have also seen it on mistletoe. This individual (20mm long) was observed eating a Black Wattle shoot, see second photo.'
