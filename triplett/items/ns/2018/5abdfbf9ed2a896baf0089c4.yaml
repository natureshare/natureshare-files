description: 'Larval food plants are in the citrus family and do not exist in the park. I have previously seen the species mating at the Gellibrand Hill summit, and I assume this one next to Providence Road was there for the same purpose. I may have seen one in exactly the same spot last year. Presumably it is the closest place to someones Lemon tree that matches the criteria for a mating site.'
