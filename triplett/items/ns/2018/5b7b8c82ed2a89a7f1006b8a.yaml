The one on Acacia mearnsii is called Uromycladium murphyi. See \"Diversity of gall-forming rusts (Uromycladium, Pucciniales) on Acacia in Australia\" by C.

    text: 'Hi Jeff, great to have you keeping ahead of the game! Split into 16 species - that''s a lot!  We usually wait until the new names appear in the ALA before updating. The ALA names are sourced from Ausfungi (MEL)'
