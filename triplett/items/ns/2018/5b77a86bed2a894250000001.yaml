description: "These are bud galls on Black Wattle, which I believe are caused by Dasineura rubiformis. The species is described in Kolesik, P., Adair, R.J., and Eick, G (2005) \"Nine new species of Dasineura (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) from flowers of Australian Acacia (Mimosaceae)\", Systematic Entomology 30:454-479. You can find photos on the web from south africa and portugal since this species has been released for biological control of black wattle. It was found not to affect the growth of plantation trees, but drastically reduces seed production and therefore invasiveness. Species is fairly common in Woodlands Historic Park.\r\n"

    text: I'll add the species to the database if you are confident of the species. I can also add the genus only if you want to play safe

    text: I am not sure anything can be identified to "professional standard" from a photo but rubiformis seems to be the only one in the paper that matches. Adair did a pretty comprehensive search for galls on the invasive acacia so there are unlikely to be any undescribed species on A. mearnsii. I say call it rubiformis until one of the professionals sees it and contradicts!
