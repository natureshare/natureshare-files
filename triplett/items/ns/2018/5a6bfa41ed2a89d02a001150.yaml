    text: The wasp is parasitising a case moth through its case. Probably Hyalarcta nigrescens.

    text: I assume the moth is in the pupal stage since the bag is looks pretty permanently attached and I don't see an opening? I am just asking because your wording implies it is not a pupa.

    text: It may be a pupa. It may also still be a caterpillar. They are efficient at sealing themselves in. There are openings at the top and bottom. The amazing thing is the wasp's ability to find the case and be adapted to have a long enough ovipositor to be effective. The image shows something that is rarely if ever seen.
