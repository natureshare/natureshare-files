    text: 'Certainly a Peziza species but determining which one is more difficult. P. tenacella appears on burnt ground and charcoal and is the right size, however it is violet coloured when young and ages to brown. These specimens should still be in the violet stage if they were that species. There are other species listed for burnt ground but they all retain a violet colouration. Another option is P. echinospora which is also found on burnt ground. This species appears in Fuhrer but is not listed on ALA. A check on the Australasian Virtual Herbarium shows that several collections have been made by reliable sources that list this name, (Genevieve Gates and Pam Catcheside). Dennis''s British Cup Fungi describes many Peziza species including P. echinospora under a different name and advises it reaches 80mm diam but is "usually much smaller". Your image certainly has many similarities to this species but I think the safest name for now is Peziza spp.'
