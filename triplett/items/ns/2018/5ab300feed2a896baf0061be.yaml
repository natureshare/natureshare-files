description: 'These galls are on the same shrub-sized Yellow Box as my previous observation https://natureshare.org.au/observations/5a1e4125ed2a8962be004e40. The old galls are still there but this new form of gall covers all new shoots.'

    text: 'The galls of females are a bit of a weird shape because they have an inquiline living in them: a galler galling the gall. Probably a wasp but could be a fly.  There are some tubular galls of males on the galls of females.'

    text: 'I actually saw a wasp on one of these galls,  Callibracon sp. I suspect. I did not have the camera with me but there is a similar wasp shown on a gall in a previous post in this group. '

    text: 'I had assumed the wasp was parasitizing the gall insect, perhaps the inquiline is a different species again.'

    text: I would love to know why the Apiomorpha love this little sapling so much when there are lots of apparently more healthy Yellow Box saplings around it that they don't touch. Very poor dispersal ability?
