description: 'There were large numbers of these very small beetles on the Myoporum insulare on Providence Road adjacent to Woodlands Historic Park. (These were planted by the council and do not occur in the Park.) I believe the enlarged hind femur identifies it as a flea beetle, tribe Alticini, which narrows it down to one of 232 species according to AFD'
