    text: 'Thanks. Certainly looks like it. After doing some research it appears to be the Pittosporum family that is the host rather than just the genus - McDonald and Grigg in "The life cycle of ''Cuspicona simplex'' Walker and ''Monteithiella humeralis'' (Walker) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae)" (General and Applied Entomology Volume 12 1980) quoting another author give the host taxa as Sollya heterophylla, Copromosa sp. and Pittosporum sp. However Bursaria spinosa is also in the family.'
