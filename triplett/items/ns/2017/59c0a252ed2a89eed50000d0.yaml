    text: 'Hi David, based it on the description of the abdominal pattern in T . R . New (1984) Revision of the Australian Ascalaphidae (Insecta : Neuroptera). Australian Journal of Zoology Supplementary Series 100:1-86. Not 100% conclusive except that there are only 4 species that have been found in Victoria according to New (plus the one that Ken found at Neds Corner, but that hardly counts as Victoria!).'
