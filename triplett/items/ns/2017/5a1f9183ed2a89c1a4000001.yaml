description: "On small Yellow Box (coppice regrowth). Many adults (mostly paired) and nymphs on same tree and another nearby. Closest photographic match I have found on the web is Eurymelops rubrovittata, but this seems to be a different species. Host trees will probably be slashed by Parks Victoria soon as in previous two years.\r\nUpdate: I have added another photo which shows the markings on what I assume to be the female. Since these match other photos on the web (including museum specimens on ala) I have changed the species to Eurymelops rubrovittata."
