    text: "Interesting. I did a search on google scholar and found the following sentence \"As a family the Triozidae feed on a broad range\r\nof dicotyledonous host plants with the notable exception of the Leguminoseae\". see A new genus and ten new species of jumping plant lice (Hemiptera: Triozidae)\r\nfrom Allocasuarina (Casuarinaceae) in Australia, Taylor et al 2011."
