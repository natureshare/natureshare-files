   "content_text": "The first photo shows some lerps and what I  assume is a psylid nymph. Psylid nymphs except for the first stage crawlers should not normally be seen but I read that sometimes they move to a different location to feed, which would make sense since the leaf seems to be quite badly damaged. Other photos show what appear to be newly emerged adults on the same red gum sapling. I assume the orange ones (about 2mm long) are female and the tiny black ones (about 0.5mm) male, but this is just a guess they could be something completely different. There were masses of lerps on this sapling and most still had nymphs in them when the photos were taken",

The male in the second photo is holding onto the female with his middle legs while vibrating his front and backs legs, usually not touching the female. Many pairs in the main group were behaving in a similar way with varying degrees of contact. In one pair the male had his hind legs stationary but was stroking the \"face\" of the female with his front legs.",
