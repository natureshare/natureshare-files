    text: "Hi Peter. In correspondence with Robert Whyte (arachnologist) over this spider sub-family, he makes this comment - \"Yes that's Pisauridae but probably Dolomedes, not Megadolomedes and certainly not Megadolomedes australianus. which has long tarsi (final or outermost leg segments.) The females are enormous but the males 5-7mm.\"\r\n\r\nCheers. \r\n"
