    text: "This beetle is a leaf beetle.  It is a Paropsisterna sp.  It is close to the more common Paropsisterna beata  http://natureshare.org.au/observations?utf8=%E2%9C%93&user_id=martinl&species=Paropsisterna+beata&tag=  but I think it is different.  \r\nI have seen it only twice in Melbourne but didn't find a species name yet that I am confident with.  See it here (image number 11) \r\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/paropsisternapages/paropsisterna-x5 \r\nUsually found under bark.   This species is nocturnal, at least in Victoria. \r\nMartin   "
