    text: 'Going by the shape of the corolla, most likely Lobelia gibbosa but similar to Lobelia simplicicaulis which has different (oblanceolate) leaves. Both found in the Wye River area.'

    text: 'More likely to be Lobelia simplicicaulis. Lobelia gibbosa has white line on the bottom three corolla (From http://saseedbank.com.au/). Maybe better as Lobelia spp.'

    text: 'Thanks for the great tip. I see that only the central corolla lobe has the white line(s), so not gibbosa. I agree though to be safe, leave as Lobelia sp.'
