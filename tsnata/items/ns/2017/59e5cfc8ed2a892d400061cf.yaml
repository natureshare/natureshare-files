    text: 'I don''t believe it''s a thornbill. The bill and legs are too robust.  The overall buff colour, including the whole dorsal surface of the tail, suggests to be that it might be a juvenile Chestnut-rumped Heathwren.'

    text: I sent the image to a few birding friends and they said that this is a Brown Thornbill. If you lighten up the image you will see the streaks on the breast and the scalloped forehead.

    text: That's fine. I'm happy to defer to those who've had a closer look.  Don't have the facility to change the image parameters right now!
