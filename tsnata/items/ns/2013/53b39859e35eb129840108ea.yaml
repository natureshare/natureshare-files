    text: 'A type of Flea Beetle. ID assistance from SJ who said "These are flea beetles - note the huge femurs on the hind legs (adapted for jumping).  Family: Chrysomelidae, Sub-family: Galerucinae, in the Alticine group.  Apparently the Alticine group has only recently been put in with the Galerucinae (about 65 genera in Galerucinae!)".'
