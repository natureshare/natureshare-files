    text: 'Hi Thomas. I would suggest this bird to be the more common White-throated Treecreeper. The brow is not white, but rather a small white lining to the upper side of the eye. The White-browed Treecreeper has not previously been recorded this far south and prefers alternative habitat (usually Buloke or Belah). Also, I believe that in the flesh the White-browed Treecreeper is noticeably smaller (something of the which the photo cannot reveal).'
