    text: 'Stem is red and hairless like P. linifolia but flowers are not pendulous. P. humilis has densely hairy young stems, I think.'

    text: Agree with David about hairs on stem but wonder if this is variable as I am seeing all combinations this year.

    text: Further look in field and humilis most commonly rather hairy on stem below inflorescence. Perhaps linifolia it is.
