description: 'a young australian fur seal with rope  tangled around its neck. Contacted Mark Keenan from Marine Response Unit from Melbourne Zoo (0447 158 676), who diagnosed the seriousness of the situation and drove from Melbourne, but unfortunately the seal has left the rock. Mark said that if the seal was not rescued, the rope would cut into the skin and could caused fatal infection. Public is encouraged to report sick, injured or distressed marine wildlife to MRU directly.'
