    text: 'Thomas and Mark. Thanks. This is a new one for me. Yes, definitely Ephydridae - these flies have water-repelling hairs that allow them to suspend themselves on the water surface and draw in algae etc. from the water surface. Often occur on newly flooded sites. I''ll add this group to the NS database as it hasn''t been recorded before. Fantastic observation!'
