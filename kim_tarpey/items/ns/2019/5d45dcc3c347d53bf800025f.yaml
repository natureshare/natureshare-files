description: "There is a two week time gap between these photos. The first two photos were taken originally the second two a fortnight later. There is a subtle colour differentiation in the stem but you can clearly see the white stem of the fungi on the left and then the orange of the stem on the right of the second photo.  As the fungi aged the gills darkened - originally they were cream as can be seen on the left side of the third photo.\r\nThe Road Reserve still has quite a bit of remnant vegetation. The property slopes down to what would have been a natural gully and now is a drainage challenge for the Council, most properties have a drain through them on the lower side. "
