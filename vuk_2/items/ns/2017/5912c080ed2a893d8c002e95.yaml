    text: N. panaeola seems to be Queensland only although the yellow mark near the base of the wing does suggest panaeola. If panaeola this would be the first record on the ALA out of Queensland. It would be good to see another photo.

    text: 'I have had P. Marriott have a look at this and it is probably not N. panaeola.  He suggests that it be named Nemophora sp. and I concur, however it is a beautiful image of a wonderful little moth.'
