    text: 'Flock of mixed young and adults going after swarming ants following morning rainfall. Clearly distinguishable from rufous fantail by small size (smaller than the supurb fairy wrens they were mixed in with) intensity of red beak and temple, green back, red rump and base of tail, shorter tail never fanned, and intensity of red color.'
