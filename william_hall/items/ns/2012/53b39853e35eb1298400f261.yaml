      I suspect a family of these birds lives on the property at 32 Cutevan Cr. Although the picture is bad (blown up telephoto taken from the ride-on mower), it clearly shows key characters that distinguish it from other similar appearing rails found in Victoria: Buff belly banded up to neck, with a buff yellow patch on the breast, conspicuous light stripe above the eye, buff cheek stripe behind the eye, no white patch under tail (tail visible on another picture.)

Apparently resident on property together with two young difficult to distinguish from Baillon''s crake.'
