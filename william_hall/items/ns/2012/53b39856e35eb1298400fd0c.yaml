    text: 'Parent was first observed feeding on small whole plums in "wild" (i.e., rootstock suckers) plum tree. Young was waiting on ground. The birds then moved into a Eucalyptus thicket, where "baby" was heard to beg using a feed-me, feed-me call similar to that used by ravens and magpies. When examined with binoculars, the baby had a clearly visible pink patch on the base of the lower bill, very similar to that of a baby raven. '

    text: I've seen more this year than any other previously. But I've never seen young. Their call is also very distinctive.
