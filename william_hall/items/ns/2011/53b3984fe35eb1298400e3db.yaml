      No photo. Field marks: large size (largest butterfly I have seen in Victoria), Papilio-like wing shape rules out Cressida cressida, wings mostly bright white with black/grey veining, rear third of wing(s) deep black with row of conspicuous red orange spots, plus a few blue ones on trailing edge of wings. 

      Investigated many plants but would not alight. Condition was immaculate suggesting recent emergence from pupa. This may have accounted for the bright colors.
