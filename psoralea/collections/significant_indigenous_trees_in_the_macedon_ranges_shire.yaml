title: Significant Indigenous Trees in the Macedon Ranges Shire
description: |-
  Large old indigenous trees are vital to the health of local ecosystems.  There is no Significant Indigenous Tree Register in the Macedon Ranges Shire, therefore many large old remnant trees may be at risk.  

  This collection provides an opportunity for people to identify and map large old remnant indigenous trees across the Shire to help build a picture of our arboreal assets.
