    text: 'Delightful photographs indeed! I suspect that it''s a Horsfield''s Bronze-Cuckoo. Apparently the juveniles occasionally show no underparts barring, but that darker demarcated area on the breast/throat and the warm-toned upperparts look less like Black-eared Cuckoo.  '

    text: 'Dear Lawrie, Thank you sincerely. I do have Horsfield''s on the property, so that would make sense. I have not seen a Black-eared Cuckoo but then I am on the edge of their possible range. all the literature I checked (and all my books) pointed me towards possible Black-eared. Thank you again. '

    text: 'Black-eared Cuckoos turn up pretty frequently as far south as the You Yangs near Geelong, so range isn''t really an issue.  it''ll be interesting to see if the young bird stays with its foster family long enough to develop some more readily recognisable plumage!'

    text: 'My most current book is the 9th edition of Pizzey and Knight. I do not have a Menkhorst. I will look into it, especially as this year I have an unprecedented number of new birds. What Cuckoo it is, made me go back and look at all my old Cuckoo photographs and I have found a couple that may in fact  be Black-eared cuckoos. i need to enlarge them and have a closer look . thank you very much again.

    text: 'Hi David, That is an amazing discussion on the differences between BEC and HBC. Unfortunately, it is highly unlikely that I will know how the immature cuckoo develops. I hear it most days but I am not that good at the fine differences between calls. Especially when it comes to immature cuckoos. Thank you for adding the blog'

    text: The other factoid which might be relevant is that HBC is essentially a fairy-wren specialist when it comes to hosts.  BEC typically parasitises Speckled Warbler - maybe scrubwrens at a pinch.
