    text: 'Possibly two visits by the Heron on same afternoon.  Stayed awhile and looked like it was feeding in water - then flew off.   Late in afternoon Heron and Yellow-billed Spoonbill both visited together and again stayed a while.  Very exciting as this wetland is fairly new and just getting itself established.  Frogs are now resident here and possibly yabbies. '
