description: Beautifully made little nest hanging in the outer branches of a small Bundy eucalypt about 6 ft off the ground. Made from mainly spider webs woven together. Most likely either a buff-rumped or a Yellow Thornbill as both have been observed in the area.

    text: Acanthizidae - thornbill or Weebill I'd suggest. Less 'sock-like' than the Mistletoebird nest shown above.

    text: I'll have to add Acanthizidae spp. to the NS database and at the same time correct the classification for this group which is currently under Pardalotidae. Don't know how this would have happened.

    text: 'Yellow-Rumped Thornbill nest-"The nest is usually in the dense foliage of trees, near the end of branches or in vines or mistletoe. " Buff-Rumped Thornbill nest-"The nest is often in a crack behind loose bark on a tree trunk or in a crevice or hole in a tree trunk. It can also be on the ground, in tussock, in a tree fork, or in a shrub." (from-http://www.birdsinbackyards.net) So this is more likely to be the Yellow-Rumped Thornbill''s nest?'
