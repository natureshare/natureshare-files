    text: 'Hi Chris, while similar, it is quite different to the Cranberry Heaths as it''s not as woody or prickly feeling. Also, the leaves are always bright green rather than the red tinged Cranberry Heaths and I have not seen any flowers on these yet. The last one I observed was id, as Honey Pots ?'
