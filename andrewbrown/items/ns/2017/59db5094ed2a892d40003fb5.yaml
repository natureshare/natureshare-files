    text: 'Doesn''t really look like a Philotheca but very similar to the Dainty Phebalium, leaves and buds exactly the same but not the long stamens? Could be frshly opened flowers?'

    text: 'I like Phebalium festivum also. Anthers seem short, but perhaps variability of plants and leaves do look very good.'
