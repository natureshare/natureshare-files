    text: 'Leaves match var. scabridula and there are collections around Bendigo, including in the Whipstick by Paul Wilson who named the subsp.  I''ll leave you to investigate further and put it back to unidentified for the time being.'

    text: Leaves look to be scabrid rather than hairy. If it is var scabridula it would be an interesting record as it appears that there haven't been any records from the Bendigo area since Paul Wilson's in 1965
