    text: Could well be but I read that there are many species that look similar.  I see that the experts on Bowerbird don't often even get to the genus level from a photo. Some of our NS ids to species level are probably dodgy. Donald Hobern's photos of N. hercules on ALA show a very humped and hairy thorax.
