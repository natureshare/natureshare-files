    text: I think it's a Scarlet Robin mostly based on the large white spot above the bill

    text: 'Could well be, but I am not seeing a white spot so clearly. The dark ring appears to be a shadowline. Location is good for both Red-capped and Hooded Robins.'

    text: Juvenile Red-capped Robin based on streaking to side of breast and general shape. Less plump than a similar aged Scarlet Robin and slightly different markings. Absolutely not a Hooded Robin.
