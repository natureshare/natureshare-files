    text: 'This moth has more than 4 spots. I think quadriguttata has just the two black spots on each side, giving a total of four.'

    text: 'It matches images on ALA and a description from Butterflyhouse.com.au -"The adults are a uniform brown colour, with a row of two or four black dots across each fore wing."'

    text: Goodo - just wondering. Shows that you can't rely too much on the meaning of the name ("quadriguttata" = "four drops"). This could even be referring to something other than the wing spots. I'm enjoying all your great observations.

    text: Revised id. to D. casta because of the large number of caterpillars around soon after these moths appeared. See later observations of the Black slug cup-moth caterpillars stripping young gums of their leaves and even bark once the leaves are eaten!
