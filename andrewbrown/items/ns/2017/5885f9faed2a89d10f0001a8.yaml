    text: This one is a mystery to me. Does the flower-head ("cone") belong to the same plant? Were there others. We may have to wait for a flower.

    text: Yes all part of the same plant and there were a small group of these plants. When I saw the 'cones' they reminded me of Isopogons.

    text: 'I''m beginning to think this is Epacris impressa. Leaves, stems match and I can see the start of red flower buds in the axils of the leaves. I don''t know what the "cone" like structures are, unless they are on the tip of shoots in which case they could be shrivelled developing leaves.'
