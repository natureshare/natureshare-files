    text: Doesn't match the description of A.serrulata but more like A.prostrata as plants are approx.15cm high at most?

    text: A. prostrata is hardly ascending and leaves are broader and not whorled.

    text: 'Definitely A. serrulata which more typically grows to about 15 cm tall (Vicflora says to 30 - 60 cm but this is the maximum height possible). see http://natureshare.org.au/observations/6934 which is an exact match.'
