description: Some noisy minors harassing a nest hollow about 60cm off the ground attracted my attention. On inspection a small speckled grey 'hawk-like' bird (approx 20cm) flew out and was chased by a minor who plucked a few feathers most likely from it's tail (see other photo). It all happened too fast for a photo! 3 eggs in the nest which was lined with leaves and some grass.
