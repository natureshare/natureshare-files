    text: Hi Andrew. Petal size can be very important in these unspotted blue.purple sun orchids. You possibly have T. nuda in one if the photos. Please be mindful of posting two photos of different plants in the same observation as they may be different species.

    text: I see the difference now and will separate them. Thanks David. I don't think any are T. nuda as they were smaller than the decription. These flowers were approx 20-30mm across.
