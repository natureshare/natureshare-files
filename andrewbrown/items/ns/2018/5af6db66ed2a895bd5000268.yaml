    text: 'Very fuzzy picture which makes ID a little tricky.  It''s clearly a long-eared bat (Nyctophilus sp.), and although it''s hard to tell from the photo it looks not to have a y-shaped noseleaf. That with it''s warm brown colouration suggests that in your area it''s most likely Gould''s Long-eared Bat (Nyctophilus gouldi).'

    text: I'd go with Nyctophilus sp. as I don't think it's definitively verifiable from the photo.
