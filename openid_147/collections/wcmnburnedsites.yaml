  The overall impression I have of the entire area is that it did not burn very hot. Most of the canopy in the entire zone is only slightly singed at the lower end and not touched at all in the higher reaches. There was not much fallen timber to start with, but my impression is that even of that low volume only a small section was burnt away. Even in the Mallee vegetation type (Sandstone Rich Shrubland) the canopy was largely intact. I measured the area of the 2metre diameter circle around each stake for % of the surface black and therefore burnt. I made an observation on how much of the fallen timber in that circle had been burnt away. I judged whether the canopy above had been either burnt, only singed or remained untouched and I measured how high the black was on the nearest tree to the circle. Sometimes the nearest tree was in the circle, sometimes a bit further away. There was one site with no trees present close enough to draw any conclusions from. Site 5 and 6 were not in the
  burn zone. They can function as control sites, meaning we can measure recovery in the burnt areas over time in comparison with these two sites.
