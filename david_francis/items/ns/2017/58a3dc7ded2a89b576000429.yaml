    text: 'Great detail David. If the difference between males and females is the number of hairs between the wings, this photo would certainly enable that.'

    text: 'I think I''ve found the answer. In dragonfly species that do not display sexual dimorphism, there are differences in the terminal abdominal appendages. In the male these appendages are well-developed comprising paired dorsal cerci with a single third appendage called the epiproct below (see 4th photo). These are used for clasping the female. The female has only a vestigial pair of cerci. So that makes this individual a male, if I have this right.'

    text: Edit*there are still differences in the.....*. This difference in terminal appendages applies to all dragonflies
