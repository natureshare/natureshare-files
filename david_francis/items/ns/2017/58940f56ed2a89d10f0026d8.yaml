    text: 'It was new to us until fairly recently, even though it was right under our noses! I started a NS Collection "Dipodium pardalinum Distribution" to map the distribution. I was hoping people from Western Victoria would find it there. See https://natureshare.org.au/collections/53b39819e35eb129840000d4'
