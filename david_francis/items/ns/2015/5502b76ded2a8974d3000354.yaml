description: "A Fairy Moth. Note the super-long antennae. Size - very small, body about 8 mm long.\r\nThanks to Tony D., Ken W., Russell B. and Axel K. for help with the identification.\r\nUpdate from Axel: \"It is Nemophora topazias, not sparsella! It is a species from Acacia that seems to be more often seen in autumn. N. sparsella does not have the yellow basal spot, feeds on Bursaria and flies in early summer.\""
