    text: 'I thought S. trapezia too, which I suggested to Robert re http://www.arachne.org.au/01_cms/details.asp?ID=1846#7947. ID by Robert Whyte who added "Yes it does look like one of my pics of trapezia, but I fear it may not be correctly identified, I think both mine and yours are closer to Sidymella rubrosignata. It can be confusing from above, and there appears to be another sp. between trapezia and rubrosignata in Vic."'
