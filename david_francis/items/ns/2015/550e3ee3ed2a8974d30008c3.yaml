    text: "I do not believe that your exciting beetle discovery is Paropsis intermedia although I can see why you consider the possibility.  These are my reasons; 1/ the pronotum is uniquely very strongly puncturated (but more finely than the elytra).  2/ the pronotum is smooth along the lateral margins rather than weakly sinuate (wavy) as in intermedia.  See my image and the reference image from PaDIL to demonstrate sinuate.      https://sites.google.com/site/paropsispages/paropsis-intermedia \r\nA closer match is Paropsisterna dilatata which (I think) is a Tasmanian endemic and still not an exact match anyway.  https://sites.google.com/site/insectsoftaschrysomeloidea/suborder-polyphaga/chrysomelidae-leaf-beetles/subfamily-chrysomelinae/genus-paropsis/paropsis-dilatata \r\nPeter Merriot has an image of your exact beetle (I think on Flickr, but not sure).\r\nI am uncertain of your beetle and have not encountered one yet.  I will try a little harder to solve it.   I doubt that it feeds on fern.   \r\n"

    text: 'I am inclined to point you to Paropsis montana.  It fits in with my keys to this genus.  I only know of museum specimens which do (sometimes) share the fine puncturations on the pronotum.  It is the best feasible match in my opinion.   https://sites.google.com/site/paropsispages/paropsis-montana '
