    text: 'Yes, stunning photos David. This one and the lacewing are beautiful wildlife shots. It''s hard to gauge size from the photos but I imagine both subjects were very small?'

    text: Thanks Russell  The spider was very small as you can see from the tip of the raspberry leaf. The lacewing was about 20mm long. I just blaze away and usually at least one of the photos is in excellent focus.
