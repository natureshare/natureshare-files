    text: 'Hi David I was trying to find some identifiers for C. pusilla and came across these. However, I reckon this is C. carnea or C. fuscata. Should have more obtuse segments. See https://www.nativeorchids.co.nz/Species/Caladenia_pusilla.html for excellent images of C. pusilla.'

    text: 'Yes, I think you are right, Gary. I think we were too influenced by the small size when we ided this one years ago. I''ll change it to Caladenia genus only.'
