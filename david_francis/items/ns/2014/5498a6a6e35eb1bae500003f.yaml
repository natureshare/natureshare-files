    text: Hi David. The best key for these is in the additions/corrections at the back of FoV4. If you've used it already you can at least determine whether it is D. amoena or not. I think the key feature for amoena is leaf length less than 40cm. Otherwise it will be sp. aff. longifolia (Benambra) I think.

    text: 'Also, amoena spreads by rhizomes forming a clump over a large area - but it takes lots of time for this to develop and often amoena is seen as a single plant. The Benambra species is obviously not rhizomatous.'

    text: Leaf length certainly greater than 40cm. Leaves with entire margins - no "finger-like" projections or teeth. Also plants mainly solitary - not in spreading clumps. That makes it sp. aff. longifolia (Benambra) then?
