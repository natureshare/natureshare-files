    text: 'Have you ever spotted one of these in the Macedon Ranges David. Yesterday I spotted what I thought was a WedgeTail gliding past the Gisborne wetlands but as it flew overhead I noticed the white underbelly. I thought perhaps a pelican but the bill wasn''t large enough. '

    text: "Lawrie Conole spotted a White-bellied Sea-eagle Driving while driving south on Calder Freeway (Woodend to Melbourne) on 23/5/2015 (recorded on eBird and ALA). Also I think Mark Buckby said he has seen one over the Gisborne wetlands. I have seen one at Lauriston .... so your observation could be possible. \r\n"

    text: 'Yes, it''s possible.  I''ve seen two adult sea-eagles in the Macedon Ranges in the last couple of years.  The one David mentioned above, and also one at Tylden heading towards Coliban Reservoir on 9/10/2015.  Both surprised me, but they obviously can travel quite a bit.  They''re regular on the south side of the ranges - breeding at Melton, and I saw one catch a cockatoo at Moorabool Reservoir (Bolwarrah) in 2014.'
