    text: Do you a pic of the whole plant? C. gracilis and praecox are very different in stem length. I found some praecox flowers two weeks ago at Mt. Tenerife along with some plants still in bud. The altitude there was over 600m I think. What is the altitude at your location?

    text: I don't have a photo of the whole plants but they were all under 15 cm tall. Altitude of location was 475 m.
