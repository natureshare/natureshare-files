    text: I'd say it isn't cucullata. If you look at gracilis records there is surprising variability with red- and yellow-tipped clubs on labellum. The colouring of the back of rear sepal is identical across gracilis and different to cucullata. But I'm happy to be wrong though.

    text: 'I gave a lot of weight to the lack of scent compared a C. gracilis about 50 m away which had a strong musky scent. The lack of deep purple colour on the labellum tip probably rules out C. cucullata, so I''ll change the id.'
