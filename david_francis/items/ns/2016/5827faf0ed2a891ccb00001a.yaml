    text: 'Common name is misleading as it occurs in the west of the state, not just the east.'

    text: Name assigned due to split with similar Caladenia iridescens that is now known to be restricted to western Victoria (principally Grampians). C. transitoria is more common in the east of the state but also scattered across the west.
