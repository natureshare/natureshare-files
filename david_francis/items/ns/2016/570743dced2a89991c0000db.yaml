description: "One of two visiting the Camelia sasanqua in my garden. We have two species of Mistletoe in our garden, so I'll keep watch to see if they visit them.\r\nThe upperside of the wings are plain white with some black markings. I was unable to get a photo.\r\nNot many insects at our place at the moment."
