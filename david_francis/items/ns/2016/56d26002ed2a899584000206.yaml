description: "We have been seeing this bird feeding on the small grapes on the vine on our verandah.\r\nIt takes fright easily but the shape, size and  black-streaks on the white belly give a positive identification.\r\nIt flies off quickly with the slightest disturbance before a photo can be taken."
