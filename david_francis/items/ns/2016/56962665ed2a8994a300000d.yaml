    text: 'It was an extremely hot, dry day. I wonder how echidnas keep hydrated. Do they drink? I''ve noticed quite a few echidnas moving around very actively at this time of the year.'

    text: Thanks Cathy. I think our echidna must be travelling through our place to a dam below us. I just saw a photo on Bowerbird of an echidna drinking. I don't know why I thought they survived on little or no water (like a koala?).
