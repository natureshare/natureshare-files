description: "Note the frilly margin of the labellum which is square and notched at the apex.(Distinguishes it from Microtis parviflora which has a non-frilly labellum that tapers to a point without the notch - triangular-shaped.)\r\nUpdate: Close-up photos showing labellum detail added. \r\nNote the variation in the shape/notching of the labellum. Some flowers only have minute notching on a square-ended labellum. Others have two rounded lobes with one shallow notch between them **but there is no gap or \"decurved point\" between the lobes**.\r\nThat makes it M. unifolia, I think, even though a proportion of the flowers have a bilobed labellum.\r\nLooking at photos elsewhere, it seems that the id feature \"labellum pendulous - not pressed against ovary\" can be seen in both arenaria and unifolia."

    text: This specimen is approaching M. arenaria and worth considering. Labellum well-notched and pendulous.
