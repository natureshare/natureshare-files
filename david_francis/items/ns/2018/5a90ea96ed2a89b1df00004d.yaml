    text: A caller to a radio gardening show this morning was advised to use dipel on the infestation of black caterpillars with orange spots on his lemon tree. Later in the day I found two caterpillars with the same description on my cumquat bush. What a pity that the caller wasn't advised to leave them alone and watch them turn into beautiful swallowtail butterflies. Surely worth the loss of a few leaves. (2 images).
