      <description>A small, very active dark beetle commonly called Water Penny from family Psephenidae had a slightly dorso-ventrally flattened body. The elytra showed two narrow bands of pale specks. The pronotum which was the same colour as the elytra had a pair of short pale streaks on either side of midline arising from the posterior margin. The lateral margins had pale flecks. The elytra stopped short of the terminal abdominal segments. Head was small with relatively large closely placed eyes. Antennae were segmented. &#xD;
Legs were thin with feeble tarsi.&#xD;
Flew in towards the garden lights on a warm night and then disappeared under some wood.&#xD;

      <description>This dusty blue beetle was about 13 mm long. The dorso-ventrally flattened body had a flange around both the thorax and elytra.&#xD;
Spotted under bright lights in a suburban garden on a very warm night.&#xD;
This could be P.peltatus but needs confirmation.</description>

      <title>Calosoma (Australodrepa) schayeri</title>
      <link>https://natureshare.org/item?i=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.natureshare.org%2Fleuba%2Fitems%2Fns%2F2016%2F56fd0ac0ed2a89615500006e.yaml</link>

      <description>This 20 mm long beetle looked very different to other ground beetles because of its flattened body and a thorax that is notched both anteriorly and posteriorly. Elytra showed fine parallel ridges and had a metallic sheen which reflected purple and teal colours. Legs were long had short spines.&#xD;
&#xD;
These ground beetles are said to feed on caterpillars. They are strongly attracted to U-V emitting lights and can congregate in large numbers but do not stay in one place for long. They stay hidden during the day but are very active at night. &#xD;

      <description>A small black beetle about 5 mm long with glossy black elytra with pale patches at the base. The elytra appeared to stop short of the last few abdominal segments. The scape of antennae were a pale brown and appeared to have a short spine.&#xD;
Subfamily: Lebiinae&#xD;
Thanks to Chris Lindorff for helping with identifying the beetle.</description>
