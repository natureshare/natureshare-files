The elytra showed two narrow bands of pale specks. The pronotum which was the same colour as the elytra had a pair of short pale streaks on either side of midline arising from the posterior margin. The lateral margins had pale flecks. The elytra stopped short of the terminal abdominal segments. Head was small with relatively large closely placed eyes. Antennae were segmented. \r\nLegs were thin with feeble tarsi.\r\nFlew in towards the garden lights on a warm night and then disappeared under some wood.\r\n\r\n( Please add Sclerocyphon sp.)",

They are strongly attracted to U-V emitting lights and can congregate in large numbers but do not stay in one place for long. They stay hidden during the day but are very active at night. \r\n\r\n",
