      <description>A pale moth with purple tinged wings and fringed trailing margins. Wingspan could have been about 10 to 12 mm.Each fore wing had a smudged dark patch in the middle of the inner margin which at rest formed a dark circle. On each wing was also a small dark, slightly posterior to the dark patch. Antennae were swept back. The labial palps appeared to form a "snout" with a short stiff bristle on either side at the tip.&#xD;
Seen under a bright garden light on a warm night.</description>

      <description>A large grey female Cossid with a wing span of about 175 mm. It made a crash landing and thrashed &amp; skidded about on its back rubbing-off most of its scales on the thorax and wings. It finally calmed down when offered a large piece of eucalyptus bark. There were no significant patterns on wings or thorax on the grey upper side. The undersides of the wings were a deep pinkish-brown with a pale edging to the inner margin of the fore wings. The abdomen was thick and densely covered with brown tinged setae dorsally and was white on the ventral side.&#xD;
Attracted to bright lights on building near a National Park.</description>

      <description>An attractive pale brown moth with a wing span of about 20 mm. The fore wings had diffuse dark brown patches with two thin white lines in the mid-wing region and a line in the submarginal area curving towards the trailing margin and ending in a small white spot. The costa near the trailing margin also showed small white specks. Apices were pale. &#xD;
The thorax showed a flash of white and this aligned with a single patch of white along the inner margin of each forewing, evident when the wings parted (pic 2).&#xD;
Hind wings were a pale orange and appeared to have fringed margins. The dorsal aspect of the abdomen and legs were also tinged with a pale yellow.&#xD;
Very active moth. Spotted on a warm night under bright garden lights. Would greatly appreciate help with identification. Thanks.</description>

      <description>A moth with a wing span of about 30 mm. It was more grey than brown with the fore wings showing a central transverse band. Each fore wing had two oblique black lines, one running from wing base downwards to the inner margin and a shorter one from the apex of each fore wing running upwards.&#xD;
Spotted under bright lights on a warm night in a suburban garden. Mixed native trees around. Also near a national park.&#xD;
 I am hoping the moth will return tonight so I can get a better shot/natural light.  Thanks to Cathy Powers for confirming this as Dysbatus.</description>

      <description>This moth had an attractive shimmer to its grey-brown wings. The wing veins stood out and were a distinctive brown. Each fore wing had two thin transverse black lines that together formed a band when at rest. Within the band was a small black crescent shaped mark. A narrow black line traversed the thorax along the anterior edge. Underside of wings were pale with dark sooty patches nearer the trailing margins. Wing span would have been about 30 mm.&#xD;
Spotted in a suburban garden. Probably attracted to lights at night.&#xD;

      <description>This is one of the most attractive of pyralids. It sat upright resting on its legs, hlding up a recurved abdomen. Wings ( span about 15 mm) were a beautiful and rich mix of deep red and orange. The fore wings were divided into three parts with the mid section showing a dark spot near the costa. Antennae were swept back.&#xD;

      <description>This large cossid moth had a wing span of at least 70 mm. There were no patterns on its grey wings however, the wings looked like sand-paper. The hind wings were shorter and a beautiful purplish brown. some of this colour was also seen in the abdominal segments nearer the thorax. Abdomen was very thick. antennae were short, feathery and brown.&#xD;
 It was interesting to see this moth in flight - lifting its heavy body into the air after a short "taxiing". On ground, the moth could be heard fluttering from several metres away. &#xD;
Spotted under bright lights near a national park. Need help to ID this large cossid. thanks.</description>

      <description>A Cossid moth about 40 mm long. Fore wings were a pale grey with a central darker area. Midway along the costa was a semicircular patch of white. A short diagonal patch of dark grey was seen along the trailing edge of the fore wings. The thorax had the inverted black "V" as in all most other cossids.&#xD;
Spotted under bright lights near native trees. &#xD;
One of many cossids spotted that year. According to Peter Marriott , this is near Trismelasmos donovani. My thanks to Peter M for the ID and to Cathy Powers for facilitating the identification.</description>

      <description>This cossid moth was about 45 mm long. Mostly grey with tinges of light brown. The basal part of the fore wings had hatched markings of dark grey, the pattern running down to the apices of each wing. Hind wings were grey with the colour fading towards the sub marginal area. On each side of the thorax, running along the length of it was a broad band of dense white setae and just inside the band was a black line of setae ending posteriorly in a thick tuft. Antennae were feathery.&#xD;
Spotted under bright lights near national park.&#xD;

      <description>A brown moth with wing span about 40 mm. Thorax was covered with short dense brown setae. Fore wings were sectioned into three by thin dark jagged lines.  The hind wings were a bright orange with dark brown sub marginal area. Antennae were feathery.&#xD;
This moth was high up on the wall so the photo is a little skewed. Also, could not get rid of the pesky alates that were everywhere last night.  My thanks to Cathy Powers for the ID.</description>

I need help with identifying this moth. Thanks. I have checked Oecophoridae and Gelechioidea but can't find a match ! </description>

      <description>A dark moth with a wing span of about 35 to 40 mm with dense setae on thorax and legs. Fore wings had scalloped trailing margins. Faint flecks of yellow-green were seen on costa and submarginal areas of wings. Feathery antennae were a deep red. Labial palps short.&#xD;
Could not make out much else against the darkness of the velvety wings but could see fine wavy lines. There were about three of these moths around bright lights on a cool evening.&#xD;

      <description>Three clouded footman males were seen fluttering around for awhile before settling on a door frame. On closer inspection I could see one of them was successful in finding and mating with a wingless female seen here as a furry white ovoid shape with thin black bands and pale orange spots along the sides. The males were of two sizes and had distinctly pectinated antennae. The mating male can be seen head pointing downwards. Beside the female was a hairy cocoon and an empty pupal case probably recently vacated by the female. Within the hairy cage was also small wrinkled piece of skin shed by the caterpillar before pupating. Pic 3 was taken 6 days later when two of the moths had flown away and the other was clear-off the female. The female had started laying eggs seen here as minute glistening orbs. The female had the same colours as seen on the caterpillar. Will wait to see what happens next.....</description>

      <description>This Chrysalis was seen about 12 days after the small early instar of this butterfly was seen. It was hard to differentiate between the pupa and plant stem as it looked very much in colour &amp; form like a stem gall induced by a citrus gall wasp. One end of the 3 cm pupa was bifurcated.</description>

      <description>This attractive dark brown butterfly had a wing span of about 50 mm. Both fore and hind wings had bright yellow patterns much like the common brown, except only the hind wing had a distinct eye spot (on the upper side). This butterfly showed a long style-like yellow marking on the fore wing ( pic 1), which is a sex-brand and seen only in males. The underside of the fore wings showed a dark patch on a background of pale gold with a small eye spot at the apex. The hind wing had beautiful patches of purple with two small eye spots, one near the costal margin and the other near the trailing margin.&#xD;
Spotted on a grass verge in a nature reserve. It was flitting about landing one one clump of grass for a few seconds before going to another.</description>

      <description>This observation features just one tree which accommodated every stage of the life-cycle of the common imperial blue or imperial hairstreak butterfly. Pic 1 shows a male butterfly resting beside a pupa. Pic 2 shows a cluster of pale blue-grey eggs with fascinating spikey outer coverings (see reference link in notes). The caterpillar in pic 3 had small horn-like tubercles along the dorsal aspect of the body. Pic 4 shows a cluster of glossy dark pupae and pic 5 shows the exuviae. &#xD;
Pic 6 is that of an adult. &#xD;
Every stage of this butterfly was attended by hoards of ants (Iridomyrmex ). They were running around all over the tree , clustering in large numbers around the pupae. There were ants around the eggs and caterpillar. &#xD;
Another interesting feature was the fine webbing around the eggs and the pupae.&#xD;
Spotted on a black wattle tree (Acacia mearnsii) near wetlands at a retarding basin.</description>
