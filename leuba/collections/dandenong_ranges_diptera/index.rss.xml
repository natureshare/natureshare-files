      <description>These attractive beeflies were seen mating amongst leaf litter. There is clear distinction between the female and the male with the female having well separated eyes(Pic 3) and the male with large eyes together with only a thin line of separation (Pic 2). The male beefly has a single bright white spot at the base of each wing as seen in pic 2. The female has no such spots and (which is on the left-hand side) has brighter white abdominal bands and a pair of lateral tufts of white setae.&#xD;
Spotted in a nature reserve.</description>

      <description>This was a very active fly about 5 or 6 mm long. Head and thorax were black and the thorax showed two faint thin white lines. The head had two short pointed black antennae that were either held straight up like horns (Pic 1) or slicked back. &#xD;
A long proboscis was out lapping up the nectar on the flower disc (pic 1). The abdomen was a raspberry red with faint white lines. The last segment was black and the two anterior to this were white. &#xD;
Legs were black and long. The wings were tinted black but plain.&#xD;
Tony Daley's (Insects of Tasmania) comment on this spotting : "Comes remarkably close to the female of Hardy's (1934) Apalocnemis sanguineus (Qld). That species has the wing dark suffusion more restricted basally. He mentions at the end of that description "a closely allied species" collected from Ringwood (Vic) which has "the wings suffused intensely over a larger area". Hardy (1934) : http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/... Note that Hardy has that species in Empidinae but it is currently placed in Brachystomatidae." </description>
