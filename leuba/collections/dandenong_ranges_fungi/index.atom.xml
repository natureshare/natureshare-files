    <content type="text">Caps of this bright orange mushroom were no more than 10 mm with a deep central depression. Younger fruiting bodies were almost hemispherical, flattening out as the mature. Caps showed some striation and margins were wavy. &#xD;
Stipe was smooth and slightly paler than the cap.  Could not get a shot of the gills. Possibly Rickenella fibula.</content>

    <content type="text">This beautiful toothed coral fungus was seen in two clumps, a large one about 170 mm across and a smaller one within the tree hollow. The small clump was fresh, white and highly branched with multiple soft spines. The larger clump was slightly old, drier with stiffer spines.&#xD;
Spotted on a damp tree stump - Beech&#xD;

    <content type="text">Poking out of the ground to about 90 mm were a number of these black club-shaped fruiting bodies. Structurally they were differentiated into black clubs above and pale greenish yellow stems below. The older thicker clubs had white fluffy material on the dark clubs.&#xD;
Spotted under a mature Acacia tree. There were about 20 and all well separated.&#xD;
The white material on the fruiting bodies are thread-like spores. They break up into 3 -5 mm long part spores which penetrate the ground and infect caterpillars of moths which could be well below the surface, even up to 40 cms. The fungus consumes the soft tissue of the host and grows up wards to the ground surface were black fruiting bodies appear and thicken to maturity. Moth larvae of the genus Oxycanus ( Hepialidae) are said to be the common hosts to this fungus. &#xD;

    <content type="text">Attractive clump of toffee coloured caps with slight convexity, a small discrete umbo and rolled in margins. Gills were a pale brown. these must have been covered by a thin cortina which could be seen tearing-off some of the younger caps (pic 3). The remnants of a brown spore-stained cortina could be seen as a wispy annulus around the stipe. The stipe below the annulus was a dark brown with white fibrils.&#xD;
Spotted groiwng as a clump on dead wood in a forest with mixed native trees.</content>

    <content type="text">Caps were a bluish yellow with fine cracks with young ones rising out of the ground like pale purplish puff balls. Mature caps were about 55 mm wide with a central depression. Gills and stipe were cream coloured. The stocky fruiting body was quite close to the ground. The spore print was a pale cream (photo not good enough to post).&#xD;
Spotted in damp soil a eucalyptus forest.</content>

    <content type="text">Pic 1 shows the underside of the cap of this thick white fungus. The fertile surface showed closely packed white "teeth" instead of gills or pores. The teeth were decurrent ( running down the stem) -pic 4. The young fruiting bodies were growing in a clump with some of their thick white stipes fused together. The caps were a pale orange, distorted by mutual pressure and showed in-rolled margins. The stem turned a beautiful orange when bruised or cut.&#xD;
Growing on a damp eucalyptus forest floor, among leaf and wood debris.&#xD;
