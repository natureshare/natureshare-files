      <description>A pale moth with purple tinged wings and fringed trailing margins. Wingspan could have been about 10 to 12 mm.Each fore wing had a smudged dark patch in the middle of the inner margin which at rest formed a dark circle. On each wing was also a small dark, slightly posterior to the dark patch. Antennae were swept back. The labial palps appeared to form a "snout" with a short stiff bristle on either side at the tip.&#xD;
Seen under a bright garden light on a warm night.</description>

      <description>These were small wrinkled 5 mm wide balls at the end of stems of a casuarina tree. At least one small branch had several of these with holes ( parasitoid ?). Most were dry but a single fresh green gall on the same branch had a knobbly surface. When dissected the gall showed several thick-walled locules.&#xD;
These look similar to galls seen on C.glauca induced by the gall wasp Selitrichodes.  I would greatly appreciate help with identifying the gall inducer and the Casuarina species. Thanks.</description>

      <description>A large grey female Cossid with a wing span of about 175 mm. It made a crash landing and thrashed &amp; skidded about on its back rubbing-off most of its scales on the thorax and wings. It finally calmed down when offered a large piece of eucalyptus bark. There were no significant patterns on wings or thorax on the grey upper side. The undersides of the wings were a deep pinkish-brown with a pale edging to the inner margin of the fore wings. The abdomen was thick and densely covered with brown tinged setae dorsally and was white on the ventral side.&#xD;

      <description>An attractive pale brown moth with a wing span of about 20 mm. The fore wings had diffuse dark brown patches with two thin white lines in the mid-wing region and a line in the submarginal area curving towards the trailing margin and ending in a small white spot. The costa near the trailing margin also showed small white specks. Apices were pale. &#xD;
The thorax showed a flash of white and this aligned with a single patch of white along the inner margin of each forewing, evident when the wings parted (pic 2).&#xD;
Hind wings were a pale orange and appeared to have fringed margins. The dorsal aspect of the abdomen and legs were also tinged with a pale yellow.&#xD;
Very active moth. Spotted on a warm night under bright garden lights. Would greatly appreciate help with identification. Thanks.</description>

      <description>A smooth white moth with a wing span of 40 mm, with, as the name suggests two small spots of black on the wings. Surprisingly, the underside showed orange and black banding on the dorsal side of the abdomen and a white belly. The legs were covered with short orange coloured setae. Eyes and antennae were black. labial palps were rec-curved.</description>

      <description>Solitary stalked outgrowths from stems of a eucalyptus tree ( species not known) about 25 mm long and about 5 mm at the thickest part. One of them had split outer layers and a definite pointy tip. This gall was parasitised. &#xD;
There were two similar but smaller galls on other branches but these had rounded tips. The galls were all dry.</description>

      <description>Caps of this bright orange mushroom were no more than 10 mm with a deep central depression. Younger fruiting bodies were almost hemispherical, flattening out as the mature. Caps showed some striation and margins were wavy. &#xD;
Stipe was smooth and slightly paler than the cap.  Could not get a shot of the gills. Possibly Rickenella fibula.</description>

      <description>This attractive sea weed had a zig-zagging tough central stalk with small densely clustered bladder like blades, arising at points in the zig-zag. Some blades had a bifurcation. The whole body of the seaweed was a brownish green with dark brown tinges.&#xD;
Said to grow in the low intertidal and shallow subtidal rocky reefs with moderate wave action, to depth of 10 m. &#xD;
Spotted along the high tide mark on a sandy shore, along with other sea weeds - Western Port Bay &#xD;

      <description>This pale reddish brown elongated sac-like structure with a club shaped tip and narrow base is part of a red seaweed which grows in a clump, attached to the sea floor by a  discoid holdfast. The inside of the bladder appears to be filled with mucilage. This bladder was about 50 mm long.&#xD;
This seaweed can grow up to 16 cms in length. The outer walls of sacs growing in rough waters are said to be thicker than those in calm waters. The secretory cells lining the inside of the sacs produce highly viscous mucilage. &#xD;
Spotted along the high tide mark along with other sea weeds on a sandy beach - Western Port Bay. &#xD;
Occur in Seagrass beds upto a depth of 20 mts. &#xD;

      <description>This coiled thin shell with pale orange bands is that of a marine gastropod/snail that lives in a coiled tube. The snails resemble tube worms (polychaetes) because of the structure but are in a different family. The tube is usually cemented to other structures. Unlike other snails, this species does not have an operculum or lid.&#xD;

      <description>A bivalve with paper-thin shells and about 40 mm wide. It had broken orange bands radiating from the umbo (where the valves are hinged). A very fragile specimen that was surprisingly intact despite being blown about in the wind. The slightly flared part of the shell near the umbo (on the Lt side in Pic 1) is called the auricle or wing, giving the species it's common name. &#xD;

      <description>This slate-pencil sea urchin would have been about 50 mm across. It had probably just died and been washed ashore - still had most of its short thick primary spines and smaller needle like secondary spines. &#xD;
The primary photo is of the top side (aboral) and the second is of the underside (oral) with the mouth in the middle. Just visible in pic 4 is a triangular white tooth-like structure in the centre which is part of a complex dental apparatus called the "Aristotle's Lantern". &#xD;
The shorter spines were a deep red and the thicker ones were paler, some with deep red ridges. It is possible that a few long ones were broken at this stage.&#xD;
Spotted on the rocky ocean shore -low tide mark on the south coast. (Phillip Island)&#xD;

      <description>Sea squirts/ tunicates/ascidians which appeared like clumps of collapsed "sand-crusted" sacs stuck to a sea fan. Each sac had two openings with scalloped edges - one on top and the other to the side (inhalant &amp; exhalant siphons). The sacs seemed to have a reddish tinge. The inside of each sac had organs which were red in colour with a brown segment towards the base (pics 3 &amp; 4). The organs seemed to be covered by mucilaginous substance. Commonly also called Conjevoi.&#xD;

      <description>The anemone was about 50 mm with tentacles extended and floating in the water. Tentacles were numerous, translucent but dark green in colour and had pointy ends. The oral disc was covered by sand and therefore not visible. &#xD;
Where the anemones were out of water, they looked like dark clumps studded with sand grains. Partially submerged anemones (pic 3) were interesting in that the submerged part had extended tentacles and the exposed part was curled up displaying a sand encrusted column. Long striations could be seen in the retracted column which was the same colour as the tentacles.&#xD;

      <description>This mass resembling worn coral was about 10 cms across. On the surface were crescent shaped structures which were the open ends of calcareous tubes constructed by tubeworms. They have clustered together and probably grown on a snail, completely enveloping it and forming a hard mass, as suggested by Audrey Falconer(Marine Research). The mass was partially covered with sand but red algae could be seen growing on the mass.&#xD;
The tubes are built by annelid fanworms from the family Serpulidae. The worms have branchial crowns in two lobes, one of them has a stalked operculum (lid). The branchial croown form the gills and also helps to capture food. &#xD;
The worm lives within the tube and retracts into the tube when in danger or when the tide is out, pulling the operculum down tight to shut the opening of the tube. A dense mass of tubes can form a microhabitat for other marine creatures. My thanks to Audrey Falconer ( Marine Research) for identifying this mass. &#xD;
Spotted in a rock pool in an intertidal zone of a rocky shoreline ( Cape Conran, Victoria). These tubeworms are seen from Southern Queensland all along the southern coast to Western Australia.</description>

      <description>A mollusc with a flattened body and eight distinctive overlapping plates that protect them from predators and crashing waves. This chiton was grey-green in colour, about 63 mm x 35 mm. The girdle encircling the plates had a snake-skin like appearance giving it the common name "snakeskin chiton".&#xD;
These chitons were found along with barnacles, attached to the side of a rock in an intertidal rocky shore (Cape Conran) off the south coast of Victoria facing the Bass Strait. &#xD;
This species is said to prefer rock surfaces in the mid-tide region, rather than under rocks in lower -or sub-tidal zones. &#xD;

      <description>A brown algae with a thallus (body) with multiple holes of varying sizes. The algae is said to be about 10 cm in diameter. But in the one that was washed ashore it was a loose mesh like a woolen hair net. The whole mass was compressible and soft.&#xD;
Found on the inter-tidal zone off Western Port Bay (Balnarring Beach). They are said to grow in the tidal zone.&#xD;
'Hydro' = water, 'Clathrus' = mesh &#xD;
This species forms dense mats. &#xD;

      <description>This sea slug would have been about 5 " in length. It had mottling of cream and brown. The ear-like sensory clubs or rhinophores and oral tentacle were withdrawn and the usually extended side flaps called parapodia were flipped back. The mantle and atrophied shell could be seen (pic 5) as a reddish radiating structure.&#xD;
I have the expert Mattt  Nimbs to thank for the ID. He says "Definitely Aplysia. And yes probably A sydneyensis, there is a wheel like pattern of radiating stripes on the mantle that sits over the vestigial shell: a distinguishing characteristic of sydneyensis"&#xD;

      <description>A small, very active dark beetle commonly called Water Penny from family Psephenidae had a slightly dorso-ventrally flattened body. The elytra showed two narrow bands of pale specks. The pronotum which was the same colour as the elytra had a pair of short pale streaks on either side of midline arising from the posterior margin. The lateral margins had pale flecks. The elytra stopped short of the terminal abdominal segments. Head was small with relatively large closely placed eyes. Antennae were segmented. &#xD;
Legs were thin with feeble tarsi.&#xD;
Flew in towards the garden lights on a warm night and then disappeared under some wood.&#xD;

      <description>A moth with a wing span of about 30 mm. It was more grey than brown with the fore wings showing a central transverse band. Each fore wing had two oblique black lines, one running from wing base downwards to the inner margin and a shorter one from the apex of each fore wing running upwards.&#xD;
Spotted under bright lights on a warm night in a suburban garden. Mixed native trees around. Also near a national park.&#xD;
 I am hoping the moth will return tonight so I can get a better shot/natural light.  Thanks to Cathy Powers for confirming this as Dysbatus.</description>

      <description>This moth had an attractive shimmer to its grey-brown wings. The wing veins stood out and were a distinctive brown. Each fore wing had two thin transverse black lines that together formed a band when at rest. Within the band was a small black crescent shaped mark. A narrow black line traversed the thorax along the anterior edge. Underside of wings were pale with dark sooty patches nearer the trailing margins. Wing span would have been about 30 mm.&#xD;
Spotted in a suburban garden. Probably attracted to lights at night.&#xD;

The body had black and white stripes through the length of it and what looked like a fuzz of fine red hairs around the cephalothorax making it look like an attractive two-toned spider at a glance. Palps were large and dark suggesting that it was male.&#xD;
Spotted in a suburban garden.</description>

      <description>This is one of the most attractive of pyralids. It sat upright resting on its legs, hlding up a recurved abdomen. Wings ( span about 15 mm) were a beautiful and rich mix of deep red and orange. The fore wings were divided into three parts with the mid section showing a dark spot near the costa. Antennae were swept back.&#xD;
Attracted to bright lights in the house.&#xD;
My thanks to Cathy Powers for the ID.</description>

      <description>This large cossid moth had a wing span of at least 70 mm. There were no patterns on its grey wings however, the wings looked like sand-paper. The hind wings were shorter and a beautiful purplish brown. some of this colour was also seen in the abdominal segments nearer the thorax. Abdomen was very thick. antennae were short, feathery and brown.&#xD;
 It was interesting to see this moth in flight - lifting its heavy body into the air after a short "taxiing". On ground, the moth could be heard fluttering from several metres away. &#xD;
Spotted under bright lights near a national park. Need help to ID this large cossid. thanks.</description>

      <description>A Cossid moth about 40 mm long. Fore wings were a pale grey with a central darker area. Midway along the costa was a semicircular patch of white. A short diagonal patch of dark grey was seen along the trailing edge of the fore wings. The thorax had the inverted black "V" as in all most other cossids.&#xD;
Spotted under bright lights near native trees. &#xD;
One of many cossids spotted that year. According to Peter Marriott , this is near Trismelasmos donovani. My thanks to Peter M for the ID and to Cathy Powers for facilitating the identification.</description>

      <description>This gigantic and heavy moth was about 65 mm long and looked like a roll of burnt paper. The fore wings had attractive blotchy patches of black, brown, grey and white with the inner margins folding over each other in a wave. The grey thorax had two short black tufts of setae. Antennae were smooth and short. The abdomen was covered with dense grey setae; it looked and felt heavy.&#xD;

      <description>This cossid moth was about 45 mm long. Mostly grey with tinges of light brown. The basal part of the fore wings had hatched markings of dark grey, the pattern running down to the apices of each wing. Hind wings were grey with the colour fading towards the sub marginal area. On each side of the thorax, running along the length of it was a broad band of dense white setae and just inside the band was a black line of setae ending posteriorly in a thick tuft. Antennae were feathery.&#xD;

      <description>A dark moth with a wing span of about 35 to 40 mm with dense setae on thorax and legs. Fore wings had scalloped trailing margins. Faint flecks of yellow-green were seen on costa and submarginal areas of wings. Feathery antennae were a deep red. Labial palps short.&#xD;
Could not make out much else against the darkness of the velvety wings but could see fine wavy lines. There were about three of these moths around bright lights on a cool evening.&#xD;

      <description>These were small slightly flattened trumpet-shaped lerps spotted on eucalyptus leaves. The broader part of these lerps were transparent and appeared fragile. Each of these lerps appeared to have a nymph inside with their pale orange bodies clearly visible through the transparent lerp shell.&#xD;
Unlike lerps of Glycaspis species, I could not see any ants crawling around these lerps. I assume therefore that these lerps are not made of the same material as the Glycaspis species. Also, this species of Creiis lerps seemed keratinous. Various birds feed on lerps but a study on lerp-feeding by birds suggests that birds avoided the Creiis species of lerps.&#xD;
Spotted on Mugga Ironbark (Eucalyptus sideroxylon) in the Cocoparra National Park, New South Wales&#xD;

      <description>Three clouded footman males were seen fluttering around for awhile before settling on a door frame. On closer inspection I could see one of them was successful in finding and mating with a wingless female seen here as a furry white ovoid shape with thin black bands and pale orange spots along the sides. The males were of two sizes and had distinctly pectinated antennae. The mating male can be seen head pointing downwards. Beside the female was a hairy cocoon and an empty pupal case probably recently vacated by the female. Within the hairy cage was also small wrinkled piece of skin shed by the caterpillar before pupating. Pic 3 was taken 6 days later when two of the moths had flown away and the other was clear-off the female. The female had started laying eggs seen here as minute glistening orbs. The female had the same colours as seen on the caterpillar. Will wait to see what happens next.....</description>

      <description>This Chrysalis was seen about 12 days after the small early instar of this butterfly was seen. It was hard to differentiate between the pupa and plant stem as it looked very much in colour &amp; form like a stem gall induced by a citrus gall wasp. One end of the 3 cm pupa was bifurcated.</description>

Spotted washed ashore at Westernport Bay -at low tide. Native to Australia.&#xD;

      <description>Poking out of the ground to about 90 mm were a number of these black club-shaped fruiting bodies. Structurally they were differentiated into black clubs above and pale greenish yellow stems below. The older thicker clubs had white fluffy material on the dark clubs.&#xD;
Spotted under a mature Acacia tree. There were about 20 and all well separated.&#xD;
The white material on the fruiting bodies are thread-like spores. They break up into 3 -5 mm long part spores which penetrate the ground and infect caterpillars of moths which could be well below the surface, even up to 40 cms. The fungus consumes the soft tissue of the host and grows up wards to the ground surface were black fruiting bodies appear and thicken to maturity. Moth larvae of the genus Oxycanus ( Hepialidae) are said to be the common hosts to this fungus. &#xD;

      <description>This 20 mm long beetle looked very different to other ground beetles because of its flattened body and a thorax that is notched both anteriorly and posteriorly. Elytra showed fine parallel ridges and had a metallic sheen which reflected purple and teal colours. Legs were long had short spines.&#xD;
&#xD;
These ground beetles are said to feed on caterpillars. They are strongly attracted to U-V emitting lights and can congregate in large numbers but do not stay in one place for long. They stay hidden during the day but are very active at night. &#xD;

      <description>This female adult felt scale looked like a 5 mm long and wide, slightly raised peach-coloured patch on a leaf. The leaf surface surrounding it was damaged. faint body segments could be seen on the upper surface which had wispy white waxy secretions. The underside (pic 1) showed three pairs of legs, a slight depression between the first pair of legs ( ? mouth) and well defined abdominal segments. A pair of antennae were visible when the scale was turned over.&#xD;
Spotted on a eucalyptus tree in a reserve. Several leaves were affected by these scale but there was no more than one per leaf.&#xD;
My thanks to Dr Lyn Cook who identified this as Lobimago sp. , a Lobe-margin Felt Scale. Family: Eriococcidae&#xD;
Dr Cook writes " Was in genus Lachnodius but transferred to Lobimago by Hardy et al in 2011." . At present on ALA as Lachnodius.&#xD;

      <description>These attractive beeflies were seen mating amongst leaf litter. There is clear distinction between the female and the male with the female having well separated eyes(Pic 3) and the male with large eyes together with only a thin line of separation (Pic 2). The male beefly has a single bright white spot at the base of each wing as seen in pic 2. The female has no such spots and (which is on the left-hand side) has brighter white abdominal bands and a pair of lateral tufts of white setae.&#xD;
Spotted in a nature reserve.</description>

      <description>About 20 mm long this moth had pale yellow wings with hints of copper. Wings were tented, giving the body a wedge shape. The head and anterior thorax were almost white and the paleness continued along the costa. Thoracic setae had dark tips. Feathery antennae stretched out and were almost two-thirds the body length.</description>

      <description>A net-casting spider with its blue rectangular net which was loosely slung from the front legs. The spider was prepared to get its meal at this stage. &#xD;
Pics 2 &amp; 3 are of the spider at day time - it was magical to see the blue net which she would have made in the evening for some supper that night. Hoping I'd be able to get an action shot next time and a shot of those enormous eyes ! &#xD;

      <description>This dark attractive skipper had a wing span of 30 mm. The upper side of the fore wings had small rectangular patches of cream. The trailing margins also showed a narrow margin of broken cream patches. The upper side of each hind wing ( just visible) had a bright orange patch. As with most skippers, the thorax was covered with dense olive green setae. White spots were seen on a dark head.</description>

      <description>A fast moving attractive Swift Spider with black cephalothorax and abdomen, black and white banded hind legs and orange front legs. The body had white patterns along the sides, a median white line on the cephalothorax and broken white pattern along the midline of the abdomen.&#xD;
Its behaviour and erratic movements are a mimicry of the pompilid wasp - the orange legs move up and down like the orange antennae of the wasps. &#xD;

      <description>A delicate-looking predacious bug from the Reduviidae family. The long legs were covered with fuzzy setae. The mid and hind legs were resting on the web silk while the front pair of legs were held up folded in front of the head. The antennae looked much like another pair of legs.&#xD;

      <description>This wasp was about 20 mm long with yellow markings on thorax and head. Scutellum was yellow as were parts of the legs. The abdomen was an amber colour and slightly dorso-ventrally flattened. Wings were clear.&#xD;
My thanks to Tony D for identifying the genus and for the following information "Beautiful wasp! Features of note for Labium are the large hind claws, ovipositor just barely projecting in females (as seen here), antennae more or less semi-clavate, and head longish below eyes (shown in third pic)." </description>

      <description>This eucalyptus tree with slightly pendulous branches and small clusters of creamy white flowers had delicate young leaves with their tips curled into thick cups. These cups appeared to have a membranous pale or brown lid (pic 5). Some of these cups had ants clustering around them as in pic 4. On opening one of these lidded "cups', I found a 3 mm psyllid nymph with small red wide-set eyes, orange thorax and green abdomen. Wings buds were dark with a white substance stuck to them. The tree had several young leaves with these galls.&#xD;
Spotted on a box gum ( ? Eucalyptus microcarpa) in a bushland reserve.&#xD;
I am not sure of the relationship between the ants and this species of psyllid. The gall-forming behaviour seems similar to Trioza species of psyllid. &#xD;
My thanks to Ken Walker for confirming that this is Trioza ( species not known).&#xD;

      <description>A small plant about 10 cm high with lance-shaped leaves. The flowers were attractive with the central sepal (green) and lateral petals (brown) fused to form a hood, rising up and over the labellum. The lateral sepals were fused at the base and rose up on either side to erect points. The inside of the hood showed broad white stripes (pic 5). The same colouring could be seen on the outer side of the flower (pic 3).</description>

      <description>These are scale insect galls seen on the adaxial side of the leaf . The broad-based conical outgrowths are female galls. There were two of these, one at the base of the leaf base and another along the main vein. the gall was purplish and had a ring near the base. One of the galls showed two openings and the other a single smooth circular orifice. Also on the leaf surface were many upright tubular structures with apical openings with crenulated margins. These were male galls and they were tinged red.&#xD;

      <description>Looking like a 5 mm piece of bird-dropping, this little black and white capsule is a cocoon of an ichneumon wasp. It was attached to the leaves on this young tree and wrapped around it was the skin of its larval host - a lepidopteran. Mimicking bird-dropping and wrapping the skin of the larval host over and around is, apparently, one of the many strategies employed by ichneumonids to escape attacks from hyperparasitoids. Spotted on a young black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) in a nature reserve.&#xD;

      <description>This observation features just one tree which accommodated every stage of the life-cycle of the common imperial blue or imperial hairstreak butterfly. Pic 1 shows a male butterfly resting beside a pupa. Pic 2 shows a cluster of pale blue-grey eggs with fascinating spikey outer coverings (see reference link in notes). The caterpillar in pic 3 had small horn-like tubercles along the dorsal aspect of the body. Pic 4 shows a cluster of glossy dark pupae and pic 5 shows the exuviae. &#xD;
Pic 6 is that of an adult. &#xD;
Every stage of this butterfly was attended by hoards of ants (Iridomyrmex ). They were running around all over the tree , clustering in large numbers around the pupae. There were ants around the eggs and caterpillar. &#xD;
Another interesting feature was the fine webbing around the eggs and the pupae.&#xD;

      <description>This very attractive jumping spider was only about 6 mm long. It looked like two blobs of yellowish-orange but a closer look revealed a spider with a black cepahalothorax with an ochre colored anterior part and three thin white lines, one in the middle and two laterally placed. The abdomen had two bright orange "c"-shaped patterns facing each other with a central orange patch. All this on a background of very pale teal. The third pair of legs seemed to have dense white setae on the tarsi. The four eyes in the front were a deep green. The palps were white.&#xD;
Spotted on black wattle in a reservoir park.</description>

      <description>Commonly called "Tassel Rope-rush", this plant was growing in a clump and would have been about a foot tall stretched out. The clumps formed mats of wiry branclets that were thick and striated (pic 2). At the nodes were what looked like brown leafy bracts. The attractive branched inflorescence looked like clumps of bracts that were coppery, plump and ovoid. &#xD;
There were no sign of "normal" leaves. Several plants growing together gave the appearance of a tangled mat.&#xD;
These plants are Dioecious and this one had male flowers.&#xD;
Spotted in a sclerophyll bush - part of the Cranbourne Botanical Gardens. Soil might have been a little sandy.&#xD;

      <description>Pic 1 shows the underside of the cap of this thick white fungus. The fertile surface showed closely packed white "teeth" instead of gills or pores. The teeth were decurrent ( running down the stem) -pic 4. The young fruiting bodies were growing in a clump with some of their thick white stipes fused together. The caps were a pale orange, distorted by mutual pressure and showed in-rolled margins. The stem turned a beautiful orange when bruised or cut.&#xD;
Growing on a damp eucalyptus forest floor, among leaf and wood debris.&#xD;

      <description>This fantastic antlion looked like many other things ( a piece of moulted reptilian skin, an abandoned cobweb with trapped insects and even dried-up bird dropping.) as it clung to a dried twig. Pic 4 is a dorsal view and Pic 5 from the underside showing a dark abdomen. The head, thorax and abdomen were dark with the last abdominal segments showing some yellow. Antennae were short with slightly curved tips. The spectacular wings looked like lace with dark patterns of black and brown. When in flight, the frames of the wings were hardly visible, showing flashes of dark spatters. Body length (including long fore-wings and antennae) would have been about 50 mm.&#xD;

      <description>Called the "Notched Onion-orchid" this orchid plant was about 50 cm high. I could see a single long sheath like leaf from the centre of which rose a slender green stem bearing a spike of flowers. &#xD;
The central sepal was hooded covering the petals. Lateral sepals curled backwards. The lip was bilobed with a slightly wavy margin.&#xD;
At first this plant looked like it had unopened buds- the flowers were so small and are not conspicuous. They are apparently scented ! &#xD;
Spotted in semi-shade. </description>

      <description>The main picture shows a dissected gall exposing larvae at various stages of development with pale pink segmented bodies and a few eggs (pic 4). The galls were about 3 to 4 mm wide, shiny and green with knobbly tips. They seemed to arise from tips of leaflets (pinnules) and involved most of the leaflet (pic 2). Several of these galls were seen on the pinnae. Pic 4 shows a developing gall on a leaflet. The larvae seemed to have segments differentiated into thoracic and abdominal segments and there appeared to be three pairs of legs (pic 6) suggesting that these were mature and close to pupation ?. I assume these are midge galls and would greatly appreciate confirmation.&#xD;

      <description>These sub-conical galls with apical holes are female galls of a gall inducing scale insect. The female galls showed enlarged leaf glands. Some leaves also showed small cylindrical galls with apical openings- these were the males of the same species of scale insect (pic 3). Pic 2 shows galls of both sexes on the one leaf. &#xD;
The underside of the leaf showed slight discolouration and minimal waxy bloom (pic 4).&#xD;
Spotted on juvenile leaves of a eucalyptus tree (species unknown) in a nature reserve.&#xD;

      <description>Mountain Hickory Wattle Leaf Gall&#xD;
Several leaves of this young acacia shrub had circular to oval patches of thickened, firm, raised growths with brown encrustation on their pale convex surfaces (pics 1 to 3). The growths were concave on the underside with a outer circle of similar brown crust (pic 4). These patches did not occur in any particular part of the leaf - some involved the mid vein and others anywhere on the leaf lamina. A dissection of one of these structures revealed just thick tough plant tissue.&#xD;

      <description>This was a very active fly about 5 or 6 mm long. Head and thorax were black and the thorax showed two faint thin white lines. The head had two short pointed black antennae that were either held straight up like horns (Pic 1) or slicked back. &#xD;
A long proboscis was out lapping up the nectar on the flower disc (pic 1). The abdomen was a raspberry red with faint white lines. The last segment was black and the two anterior to this were white. &#xD;
Legs were black and long. The wings were tinted black but plain.&#xD;
Tony Daley's (Insects of Tasmania) comment on this spotting : "Comes remarkably close to the female of Hardy's (1934) Apalocnemis sanguineus (Qld). That species has the wing dark suffusion more restricted basally. He mentions at the end of that description "a closely allied species" collected from Ringwood (Vic) which has "the wings suffused intensely over a larger area". Hardy (1934) : http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/... Note that Hardy has that species in Empidinae but it is currently placed in Brachystomatidae." </description>

      <description>Highly branched clumps of fruiting bodies of slime mold. The sporocarps, about 2 mm high, appeared to have a powdery surface which is presumably a phase that this slime mold undergoes.&#xD;
Seen on the underside of fallen twigs in a damp area - nature reserve.&#xD;

      <description>Looking very much like small Camellia flower buds, these pea-sized growths could easily be mistaken for flower buds on the tea tree. They were globose, had scaly bract like outer growth and layers of soft sheaths within. They did not appear to have stalks and were seen on branches between nodes. &#xD;
 On cutting one of them open, I found at least two very small maggots at the base, not much over 1 mm in length. The inside of the gall was soft with white fibrous layers.&#xD;
Spotted on Coastal Tea Tree ( Leptospermum laevigatum) </description>

      <description>This slender leaf beetle was about 10 mm long. Ihad heavily pitted elytra with black, cream and purple stripes. The elytra appear to be drawn out into short spines at the apices. &#xD;
The black thorax had a median ridge. Segmented antennae and the legs were black. &#xD;
The beetle was resting with its body along the axis of the plant, the purplish stripes merging well with the plant.&#xD;
Spotted on cutting grass (Gahnia grandis)&#xD;

First pictures displaying displeasure - raised and tucked in head to display black bands and erectile horns.  After about 20 min. the caterpillar had descended the branch and was resting with its body totally camouflaged against the branch (pic 4).
