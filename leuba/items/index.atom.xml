    <content type="text">A pale moth with purple tinged wings and fringed trailing margins. Wingspan could have been about 10 to 12 mm.Each fore wing had a smudged dark patch in the middle of the inner margin which at rest formed a dark circle. On each wing was also a small dark, slightly posterior to the dark patch. Antennae were swept back. The labial palps appeared to form a "snout" with a short stiff bristle on either side at the tip.&#xD;
Seen under a bright garden light on a warm night.</content>

    <content type="text">These were small wrinkled 5 mm wide balls at the end of stems of a casuarina tree. At least one small branch had several of these with holes ( parasitoid ?). Most were dry but a single fresh green gall on the same branch had a knobbly surface. When dissected the gall showed several thick-walled locules.&#xD;
These look similar to galls seen on C.glauca induced by the gall wasp Selitrichodes.  I would greatly appreciate help with identifying the gall inducer and the Casuarina species. Thanks.</content>

    <content type="text">A large grey female Cossid with a wing span of about 175 mm. It made a crash landing and thrashed &amp; skidded about on its back rubbing-off most of its scales on the thorax and wings. It finally calmed down when offered a large piece of eucalyptus bark. There were no significant patterns on wings or thorax on the grey upper side. The undersides of the wings were a deep pinkish-brown with a pale edging to the inner margin of the fore wings. The abdomen was thick and densely covered with brown tinged setae dorsally and was white on the ventral side.&#xD;
Attracted to bright lights on building near a National Park.</content>

    <content type="text">An attractive pale brown moth with a wing span of about 20 mm. The fore wings had diffuse dark brown patches with two thin white lines in the mid-wing region and a line in the submarginal area curving towards the trailing margin and ending in a small white spot. The costa near the trailing margin also showed small white specks. Apices were pale. &#xD;
The thorax showed a flash of white and this aligned with a single patch of white along the inner margin of each forewing, evident when the wings parted (pic 2).&#xD;
Hind wings were a pale orange and appeared to have fringed margins. The dorsal aspect of the abdomen and legs were also tinged with a pale yellow.&#xD;
Very active moth. Spotted on a warm night under bright garden lights. Would greatly appreciate help with identification. Thanks.</content>

    <content type="text">This pale reddish brown elongated sac-like structure with a club shaped tip and narrow base is part of a red seaweed which grows in a clump, attached to the sea floor by a  discoid holdfast. The inside of the bladder appears to be filled with mucilage. This bladder was about 50 mm long.&#xD;
This seaweed can grow up to 16 cms in length. The outer walls of sacs growing in rough waters are said to be thicker than those in calm waters. The secretory cells lining the inside of the sacs produce highly viscous mucilage. &#xD;
Spotted along the high tide mark along with other sea weeds on a sandy beach - Western Port Bay. &#xD;
Occur in Seagrass beds upto a depth of 20 mts. &#xD;

    <content type="text">This coiled thin shell with pale orange bands is that of a marine gastropod/snail that lives in a coiled tube. The snails resemble tube worms (polychaetes) because of the structure but are in a different family. The tube is usually cemented to other structures.

    <content type="text">A bivalve with paper-thin shells and about 40 mm wide. It had broken orange bands radiating from the umbo (where the valves are hinged). A very fragile specimen that was surprisingly intact despite being blown about in the wind. The slightly flared part of the shell near the umbo (on the Lt side in Pic 1) is called the auricle or wing, giving the species it's common name. &#xD;

    <content type="text">This slate-pencil sea urchin would have been about 50 mm across. It had probably just died and been washed ashore - still had most of its short thick primary spines and smaller needle like secondary spines. &#xD;
The primary photo is of the top side (aboral) and the second is of the underside (oral) with the mouth in the middle. Just visible in pic 4 is a triangular white tooth-like structure in the centre which is part of a complex dental apparatus called the "Aristotle's Lantern". &#xD;
The shorter spines were a deep red and the thicker ones were paler, some with deep red ridges. It is possible that a few long ones were broken at this stage.&#xD;
Spotted on the rocky ocean shore -low tide mark on the south coast. (Phillip Island)&#xD;

    <content type="text">Sea squirts/ tunicates/ascidians which appeared like clumps of collapsed "sand-crusted" sacs stuck to a sea fan. Each sac had two openings with scalloped edges - one on top and the other to the side (inhalant &amp; exhalant siphons). The sacs seemed to have a reddish tinge. The inside of each sac had organs which were red in colour with a brown segment towards the base (pics 3 &amp; 4). The organs seemed to be covered by mucilaginous substance. Commonly also called Conjevoi.&#xD;

    <content type="text">The anemone was about 50 mm with tentacles extended and floating in the water. Tentacles were numerous, translucent but dark green in colour and had pointy ends. The oral disc was covered by sand and therefore not visible. &#xD;
Where the anemones were out of water, they looked like dark clumps studded with sand grains. Partially submerged anemones (pic 3) were interesting in that the submerged part had extended tentacles and the exposed part was curled up displaying a sand encrusted column. Long striations could be seen in the retracted column which was the same colour as the tentacles.&#xD;
Spotted in rock pools - rocky intertidal zone (Cape Conran) </content>

    <content type="text">This mass resembling worn coral was about 10 cms across. On the surface were crescent shaped structures which were the open ends of calcareous tubes constructed by tubeworms. They have clustered together and probably grown on a snail, completely enveloping it and forming a hard mass, as suggested by Audrey Falconer(Marine Research). The mass was partially covered with sand but red algae could be seen growing on the mass.&#xD;
The tubes are built by annelid fanworms from the family Serpulidae. The worms have branchial crowns in two lobes, one of them has a stalked operculum (lid). The branchial croown form the gills and also helps to capture food. &#xD;
The worm lives within the tube and retracts into the tube when in danger or when the tide is out, pulling the operculum down tight to shut the opening of the tube. A dense mass of tubes can form a microhabitat for other marine creatures. My thanks to Audrey Falconer ( Marine Research) for identifying this mass. &#xD;
Spotted in a rock pool in an intertidal zone of a rocky shoreline ( Cape Conran, Victoria). These tubeworms are seen from Southern Queensland all along the southern coast to Western Australia.</content>

    <content type="text">A mollusc with a flattened body and eight distinctive overlapping plates that protect them from predators and crashing waves. This chiton was grey-green in colour, about 63 mm x 35 mm. The girdle encircling the plates had a snake-skin like appearance giving it the common name "snakeskin chiton".&#xD;
These chitons were found along with barnacles, attached to the side of a rock in an intertidal rocky shore (Cape Conran) off the south coast of Victoria facing the Bass Strait. &#xD;
This species is said to prefer rock surfaces in the mid-tide region, rather than under rocks in lower -or sub-tidal zones. &#xD;

    <content type="text">This sea slug would have been about 5 " in length. It had mottling of cream and brown. The ear-like sensory clubs or rhinophores and oral tentacle were withdrawn and the usually extended side flaps called parapodia were flipped back. The mantle and atrophied shell could be seen (pic 5) as a reddish radiating structure.&#xD;
I have the expert Mattt  Nimbs to thank for the ID. He says "Definitely Aplysia. And yes probably A sydneyensis, there is a wheel like pattern of radiating stripes on the mantle that sits over the vestigial shell: a distinguishing characteristic of sydneyensis"&#xD;

    <content type="text">A small, very active dark beetle commonly called Water Penny from family Psephenidae had a slightly dorso-ventrally flattened body. The elytra showed two narrow bands of pale specks. The pronotum which was the same colour as the elytra had a pair of short pale streaks on either side of midline arising from the posterior margin. The lateral margins had pale flecks. The elytra stopped short of the terminal abdominal segments. Head was small with relatively large closely placed eyes. Antennae were segmented. &#xD;
Legs were thin with feeble tarsi.&#xD;
Flew in towards the garden lights on a warm night and then disappeared under some wood.&#xD;

    <content type="text">A moth with a wing span of about 30 mm. It was more grey than brown with the fore wings showing a central transverse band. Each fore wing had two oblique black lines, one running from wing base downwards to the inner margin and a shorter one from the apex of each fore wing running upwards.&#xD;
Spotted under bright lights on a warm night in a suburban garden. Mixed native trees around. Also near a national park.&#xD;
 I am hoping the moth will return tonight so I can get a better shot/natural light.  Thanks to Cathy Powers for confirming this as Dysbatus.</content>

    <content type="text">This moth had an attractive shimmer to its grey-brown wings. The wing veins stood out and were a distinctive brown. Each fore wing had two thin transverse black lines that together formed a band when at rest. Within the band was a small black crescent shaped mark. A narrow black line traversed the thorax along the anterior edge. Underside of wings were pale with dark sooty patches nearer the trailing margins. Wing span would have been about 30 mm.&#xD;
Spotted in a suburban garden. Probably attracted to lights at night.&#xD;
Thanks to Cathy Powers for the ID.</content>

    <content type="text">These attractive clumps of pale grey lichen were seen on rocks. They appeared to start of as regular clumps with soft tight branches  with minute convoluted bluish grey pads. The branches appeared to open up into long pendulous filamentous strands ending in rounded brown apothecia.&#xD;
Spotted on rocks at an altitude of 1200 mts. in a national park (Baw Baw NP)&#xD;
Wondering if this is a species of Cladonia. Any help with an ID will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</content>

The body had black and white stripes through the length of it and what looked like a fuzz of fine red hairs around the cephalothorax making it look like an attractive two-toned spider at a glance. Palps were large and dark suggesting that it was male.&#xD;

    <content type="text">This is one of the most attractive of pyralids. It sat upright resting on its legs, hlding up a recurved abdomen. Wings ( span about 15 mm) were a beautiful and rich mix of deep red and orange. The fore wings were divided into three parts with the mid section showing a dark spot near the costa. Antennae were swept back.&#xD;
Attracted to bright lights in the house.&#xD;

    <content type="text">This large cossid moth had a wing span of at least 70 mm. There were no patterns on its grey wings however, the wings looked like sand-paper. The hind wings were shorter and a beautiful purplish brown. some of this colour was also seen in the abdominal segments nearer the thorax. Abdomen was very thick. antennae were short, feathery and brown.&#xD;
 It was interesting to see this moth in flight - lifting its heavy body into the air after a short "taxiing". On ground, the moth could be heard fluttering from several metres away. &#xD;
Spotted under bright lights near a national park. Need help to ID this large cossid. thanks.</content>

    <content type="text">A Cossid moth about 40 mm long. Fore wings were a pale grey with a central darker area. Midway along the costa was a semicircular patch of white. A short diagonal patch of dark grey was seen along the trailing edge of the fore wings. The thorax had the inverted black "V" as in all most other cossids.&#xD;
Spotted under bright lights near native trees. &#xD;
One of many cossids spotted that year. According to Peter Marriott , this is near Trismelasmos donovani. My thanks to Peter M for the ID and to Cathy Powers for facilitating the identification.</content>

The basal part of the fore wings had hatched markings of dark grey, the pattern running down to the apices of each wing. Hind wings were grey with the colour fading towards the sub marginal area. On each side of the thorax, running along the length of it was a broad band of dense white setae and just inside the band was a black line of setae ending posteriorly in a thick tuft. Antennae were feathery.&#xD;

    <content type="text">A brown moth with wing span about 40 mm. Thorax was covered with short dense brown setae. Fore wings were sectioned into three by thin dark jagged lines.  The hind wings were a bright orange with dark brown sub marginal area. Antennae were feathery.&#xD;
This moth was high up on the wall so the photo is a little skewed. Also, could not get rid of the pesky alates that were everywhere last night.  My thanks to Cathy Powers for the ID.</content>

    <content type="text">A dark moth with a wing span of about 35 to 40 mm with dense setae on thorax and legs. Fore wings had scalloped trailing margins. Faint flecks of yellow-green were seen on costa and submarginal areas of wings. Feathery antennae were a deep red. Labial palps short.&#xD;
Could not make out much else against the darkness of the velvety wings but could see fine wavy lines. There were about three of these moths around bright lights on a cool evening.&#xD;

    <content type="text">These were small slightly flattened trumpet-shaped lerps spotted on eucalyptus leaves. The broader part of these lerps were transparent and appeared fragile. Each of these lerps appeared to have a nymph inside with their pale orange bodies clearly visible through the transparent lerp shell.&#xD;
Unlike lerps of Glycaspis species, I could not see any ants crawling around these lerps. I assume therefore that these lerps are not made of the same material as the Glycaspis species. Also, this species of Creiis lerps seemed keratinous. Various birds feed on lerps but a study on lerp-feeding by birds suggests that birds avoided the Creiis species of lerps.&#xD;
Spotted on Mugga Ironbark (Eucalyptus sideroxylon) in the Cocoparra National Park, New South Wales&#xD;

    <content type="text">Three clouded footman males were seen fluttering around for awhile before settling on a door frame. On closer inspection I could see one of them was successful in finding and mating with a wingless female seen here as a furry white ovoid shape with thin black bands and pale orange spots along the sides. The males were of two sizes and had distinctly pectinated antennae. The mating male can be seen head pointing downwards. Beside the female was a hairy cocoon and an empty pupal case probably recently vacated by the female. Within the hairy cage was also small wrinkled piece of skin shed by the caterpillar before pupating. Pic 3 was taken 6 days later when two of the moths had flown away and the other was clear-off the female. The female had started laying eggs seen here as minute glistening orbs. The female had the same colours as seen on the caterpillar. Will wait to see what happens next.....</content>

    <content type="text">This Chrysalis was seen about 12 days after the small early instar of this butterfly was seen. It was hard to differentiate between the pupa and plant stem as it looked very much in colour &amp; form like a stem gall induced by a citrus gall wasp. One end of the 3 cm pupa was bifurcated.</content>

    <content type="text">This green seaweed (Caulerpa cactoides) appeared in two forms, one as a cluster and the other as an elongated string of vesicles attached to flattened median segments. This variation in appearance is apparently due to wave action in different parts of the bay. &#xD;
Pic 2 shows some brown (root-like) rhizoids at the base of the seaweed.&#xD;
Spotted washed ashore at Westernport Bay -at low tide. Native to Australia.&#xD;

    <content type="text">Poking out of the ground to about 90 mm were a number of these black club-shaped fruiting bodies. Structurally they were differentiated into black clubs above and pale greenish yellow stems below. The older thicker clubs had white fluffy material on the dark clubs.&#xD;
Spotted under a mature Acacia tree. There were about 20 and all well separated.&#xD;
The white material on the fruiting bodies are thread-like spores. They break up into 3 -5 mm long part spores which penetrate the ground and infect caterpillars of moths which could be well below the surface, even up to 40 cms. The fungus consumes the soft tissue of the host and grows up wards to the ground surface were black fruiting bodies appear and thicken to maturity. Moth larvae of the genus Oxycanus ( Hepialidae) are said to be the common hosts to this fungus. &#xD;

    <content type="text">This 20 mm long beetle looked very different to other ground beetles because of its flattened body and a thorax that is notched both anteriorly and posteriorly. Elytra showed fine parallel ridges and had a metallic sheen which reflected purple and teal colours. Legs were long had short spines.&#xD;
&#xD;
These ground beetles are said to feed on caterpillars. They are strongly attracted to U-V emitting lights and can congregate in large numbers but do not stay in one place for long. They stay hidden during the day but are very active at night. &#xD;

    <content type="text">Pic 1 shows the 5th instar and Pic 2, the 3rd instar of the Crusader Bug. The younger nymph had yellow bands on his legs and a small yellow band on the antennal tips. The 5th instar shows a better developed pronotum and smart bolero-like yellow wing buds. The antennal tip were completely yellow and legs completely brown by this stage. Both were seen on the same young wattle plant.</content>

    <content type="text">This female adult felt scale looked like a 5 mm long and wide, slightly raised peach-coloured patch on a leaf. The leaf surface surrounding it was damaged. faint body segments could be seen on the upper surface which had wispy white waxy secretions. The underside (pic 1) showed three pairs of legs, a slight depression between the first pair of legs ( ? mouth) and well defined abdominal segments. A pair of antennae were visible when the scale was turned over.&#xD;
Spotted on a eucalyptus tree in a reserve. Several leaves were affected by these scale but there was no more than one per leaf.&#xD;
My thanks to Dr Lyn Cook who identified this as Lobimago sp. , a Lobe-margin Felt Scale. Family: Eriococcidae&#xD;
Dr Cook writes " Was in genus Lachnodius but transferred to Lobimago by Hardy et al in 2011." . At present on ALA as Lachnodius.&#xD;

Pics 2 &amp; 3 are of the spider at day time - it was magical to see the blue net which she would have made in the evening for some supper that night. Hoping I'd be able to get an action shot next time and a shot of those enormous eyes ! &#xD;

The body had white patterns along the sides, a median white line on the cephalothorax and broken white pattern along the midline of the abdomen.&#xD;
Its behaviour and erratic movements are a mimicry of the pompilid wasp - the orange legs move up and down like the orange antennae of the wasps. &#xD;

My thanks to Tony D for identifying the genus and for the following information "Beautiful wasp! Features of note for Labium are the large hind claws, ovipositor just barely projecting in females (as seen here), antennae more or less semi-clavate, and head longish below eyes (shown in third pic)." </content>

    <content type="text">This eucalyptus tree with slightly pendulous branches and small clusters of creamy white flowers had delicate young leaves with their tips curled into thick cups. These cups appeared to have a membranous pale or brown lid (pic 5). Some of these cups had ants clustering around them as in pic 4. On opening one of these lidded "cups', I found a 3 mm psyllid nymph with small red wide-set eyes, orange thorax and green abdomen. Wings buds were dark with a white substance stuck to them. The tree had several young leaves with these galls.&#xD;
Spotted on a box gum ( ? Eucalyptus microcarpa) in a bushland reserve.&#xD;
I am not sure of the relationship between the ants and this species of psyllid. The gall-forming behaviour seems similar to Trioza species of psyllid. &#xD;
My thanks to Ken Walker for confirming that this is Trioza ( species not known).&#xD;

    <content type="text">This attractive dark brown butterfly had a wing span of about 50 mm. Both fore and hind wings had bright yellow patterns much like the common brown, except only the hind wing had a distinct eye spot (on the upper side). This butterfly showed a long style-like yellow marking on the fore wing ( pic 1), which is a sex-brand and seen only in males. The underside of the fore wings showed a dark patch on a background of pale gold with a small eye spot at the apex. The hind wing had beautiful patches of purple with two small eye spots, one near the costal margin and the other near the trailing margin.&#xD;
Spotted on a grass verge in a nature reserve. It was flitting about landing one one clump of grass for a few seconds before going to another.</content>

    <content type="text">These are scale insect galls seen on the adaxial side of the leaf . The broad-based conical outgrowths are female galls. There were two of these, one at the base of the leaf base and another along the main vein. the gall was purplish and had a ring near the base. One of the galls showed two openings and the other a single smooth circular orifice. Also on the leaf surface were many upright tubular structures with apical openings with crenulated margins. These were male galls and they were tinged red.&#xD;
Spotted on a eucalyptus tree - ? species. Nature reserve.&#xD;
My thanks to Dr L.Cook for confirming genus and identifying the species.&#xD;

    <content type="text">Looking like a 5 mm piece of bird-dropping, this little black and white capsule is a cocoon of an ichneumon wasp. It was attached to the leaves on this young tree and wrapped around it was the skin of its larval host - a lepidopteran. Mimicking bird-dropping and wrapping the skin of the larval host over and around is, apparently, one of the many strategies employed by ichneumonids to escape attacks from hyperparasitoids. Spotted on a young black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) in a nature reserve.&#xD;

    <content type="text">This observation features just one tree which accommodated every stage of the life-cycle of the common imperial blue or imperial hairstreak butterfly. Pic 1 shows a male butterfly resting beside a pupa. Pic 2 shows a cluster of pale blue-grey eggs with fascinating spikey outer coverings (see reference link in notes). The caterpillar in pic 3 had small horn-like tubercles along the dorsal aspect of the body. Pic 4 shows a cluster of glossy dark pupae and pic 5 shows the exuviae. &#xD;
Pic 6 is that of an adult. &#xD;
Every stage of this butterfly was attended by hoards of ants (Iridomyrmex ). They were running around all over the tree , clustering in large numbers around the pupae. There were ants around the eggs and caterpillar. &#xD;
Another interesting feature was the fine webbing around the eggs and the pupae.&#xD;
Spotted on a black wattle tree (Acacia mearnsii) near wetlands at a retarding basin.</content>

    <content type="text">This very attractive jumping spider was only about 6 mm long. It looked like two blobs of yellowish-orange but a closer look revealed a spider with a black cepahalothorax with an ochre colored anterior part and three thin white lines, one in the middle and two laterally placed. The abdomen had two bright orange "c"-shaped patterns facing each other with a central orange patch. All this on a background of very pale teal. The third pair of legs seemed to have dense white setae on the tarsi. The four eyes in the front were a deep green. The palps were white.&#xD;

    <content type="text">Commonly called "Tassel Rope-rush", this plant was growing in a clump and would have been about a foot tall stretched out. The clumps formed mats of wiry branclets that were thick and striated (pic 2). At the nodes were what looked like brown leafy bracts. The attractive branched inflorescence looked like clumps of bracts that were coppery, plump and ovoid. &#xD;
There were no sign of "normal" leaves. Several plants growing together gave the appearance of a tangled mat.&#xD;
These plants are Dioecious and this one had male flowers.&#xD;
Spotted in a sclerophyll bush - part of the Cranbourne Botanical Gardens. Soil might have been a little sandy.&#xD;

    <content type="text">This fantastic antlion looked like many other things ( a piece of moulted reptilian skin, an abandoned cobweb with trapped insects and even dried-up bird dropping.) as it clung to a dried twig. Pic 4 is a dorsal view and Pic 5 from the underside showing a dark abdomen. The head, thorax and abdomen were dark with the last abdominal segments showing some yellow. Antennae were short with slightly curved tips. The spectacular wings looked like lace with dark patterns of black and brown. When in flight, the frames of the wings were hardly visible, showing flashes of dark spatters. Body length (including long fore-wings and antennae) would have been about 50 mm.&#xD;

    <content type="text">Called the "Notched Onion-orchid" this orchid plant was about 50 cm high. I could see a single long sheath like leaf from the centre of which rose a slender green stem bearing a spike of flowers. &#xD;
The central sepal was hooded covering the petals. Lateral sepals curled backwards. The lip was bilobed with a slightly wavy margin.&#xD;
At first this plant looked like it had unopened buds- the flowers were so small and are not conspicuous. They are apparently scented ! &#xD;
Spotted in semi-shade. </content>

    <content type="text">The main picture shows a dissected gall exposing larvae at various stages of development with pale pink segmented bodies and a few eggs (pic 4). The galls were about 3 to 4 mm wide, shiny and green with knobbly tips. They seemed to arise from tips of leaflets (pinnules) and involved most of the leaflet (pic 2). Several of these galls were seen on the pinnae. Pic 4 shows a developing gall on a leaflet. The larvae seemed to have segments differentiated into thoracic and abdominal segments and there appeared to be three pairs of legs (pic 6) suggesting that these were mature and close to pupation ?. I assume these are midge galls and would greatly appreciate confirmation.&#xD;

    <content type="text">These sub-conical galls with apical holes are female galls of a gall inducing scale insect. The female galls showed enlarged leaf glands. Some leaves also showed small cylindrical galls with apical openings- these were the males of the same species of scale insect (pic 3). Pic 2 shows galls of both sexes on the one leaf. &#xD;
The underside of the leaf showed slight discolouration and minimal waxy bloom (pic 4).&#xD;
Spotted on juvenile leaves of a eucalyptus tree (species unknown) in a nature reserve.&#xD;

    <content type="text">A lobulated gall probably involving terminal leaf buds. the galls were green and red and glossy. they were small, about 5 to 7mm wide. A dissected dry gall ( pics 4 &amp; 5) showed thickened concentric layers of tissue. There was no sign of any life inside the gall.&#xD;
Spotted on a prickly tea-tree (Leptospermum juniperinum).&#xD;
This gall is formed by a scale insect of the genus Eremococcus. My thanks to L.Cook for the ID.&#xD;

    <content type="text">Mountain Hickory Wattle Leaf Gall&#xD;
Several leaves of this young acacia shrub had circular to oval patches of thickened, firm, raised growths with brown encrustation on their pale convex surfaces (pics 1 to 3). The growths were concave on the underside with a outer circle of similar brown crust (pic 4). These patches did not occur in any particular part of the leaf - some involved the mid vein and others anywhere on the leaf lamina. A dissection of one of these structures revealed just thick tough plant tissue.&#xD;

    <content type="text">A highly branched black clump of fruiting bodies arising from stem galls. They were about 5 to 12 mm long and stretching out like large magnetised iron-filings.&#xD;
Spotted arising from stem galls (seen as thickened split lumps) on branches of tea-tree shrubs (Leptospermum sp.) in a reserve - Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne.&#xD;
This fungus ( basidiomycota) is a parasite on the female gall inducing Eriococcid insect Callococcus leptospermi. &#xD;

    <content type="text">This was a very active fly about 5 or 6 mm long. Head and thorax were black and the thorax showed two faint thin white lines. The head had two short pointed black antennae that were either held straight up like horns (Pic 1) or slicked back. &#xD;
A long proboscis was out lapping up the nectar on the flower disc (pic 1). The abdomen was a raspberry red with faint white lines. The last segment was black and the two anterior to this were white. &#xD;
Legs were black and long. The wings were tinted black but plain.&#xD;
Tony Daley's (Insects of Tasmania) comment on this spotting : "Comes remarkably close to the female of Hardy's (1934) Apalocnemis sanguineus (Qld). That species has the wing dark suffusion more restricted basally. He mentions at the end of that description "a closely allied species" collected from Ringwood (Vic) which has "the wings suffused intensely over a larger area". Hardy (1934) : http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/... Note that Hardy has that species in Empidinae but it is currently placed in Brachystomatidae." </content>

    <content type="text">Looking very much like small Camellia flower buds, these pea-sized growths could easily be mistaken for flower buds on the tea tree. They were globose, had scaly bract like outer growth and layers of soft sheaths within. They did not appear to have stalks and were seen on branches between nodes. &#xD;
 On cutting one of them open, I found at least two very small maggots at the base, not much over 1 mm in length. The inside of the gall was soft with white fibrous layers.&#xD;
