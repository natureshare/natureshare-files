description: "These attractive clumps of pale grey lichen were seen on rocks. They appeared to start of as regular clumps with soft tight branches  with minute convoluted bluish grey pads. The branches appeared to open up into long pendulous filamentous strands ending in rounded brown apothecia.\r\nSpotted on rocks at an altitude of 1200 mts. in a national park (Baw Baw NP)\r\nWondering if this is a species of Cladonia. Any help with an ID will be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

    text: 'This is Stereocaulon ramulosum - the brownish tips are the spore releasing apothecia and the blue-grey warty lumps are called cephalodia. This species has a dual symbiosis, the fungus and a green alga in the main structure and the fungus and a cyanobacterium in the cephalodia. Hence it represents three different kingdoms!'
