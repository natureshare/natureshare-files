description: "This moth had an attractive shimmer to its grey-brown wings. The wing veins stood out and were a distinctive brown. Each fore wing had two thin transverse black lines that together formed a band when at rest. Within the band was a small black crescent shaped mark. A narrow black line traversed the thorax along the anterior edge. Underside of wings were pale with dark sooty patches nearer the trailing margins. Wing span would have been about 30 mm.\r\nSpotted in a suburban garden. Probably attracted to lights at night.\r\nThanks to Cathy Powers for the ID."

    text: 'Cathy, Please know that when I cry for help with moths I am hoping that you would have a look at them. Didn''t know if it would be appropriate to refer them directly to you. Thanks for confirming this as Dysbatus - this is the best specimen I''ve got  so far.'
