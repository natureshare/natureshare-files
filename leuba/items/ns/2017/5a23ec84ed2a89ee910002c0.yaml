description: "This small lynx spider had a leg span of about 10 to 12 mm. Legs were pale, long and spikey. The body had black and white stripes through the length of it and what looked like a fuzz of fine red hairs around the cephalothorax making it look like an attractive two-toned spider at a glance. Palps were large and dark suggesting that it was male.\r\nSpotted in a suburban garden."
