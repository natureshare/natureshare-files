    text: Thank you for adding the ID David. My obs are enigmatic you say.. I don't have fantastic photographic equipment so I am forced to take shots of things that will not fly or run away from me but more often than not these specimens have very interesting life cycles and associations. I take shots of anything unusual and then research it afterwards - it's been great learning & very interesting so far !
