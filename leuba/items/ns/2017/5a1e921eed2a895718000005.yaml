description: "A fawn-coloured Cossid about 40 mm long, No distinct patterns on wings but darker along the veins. Antennae were brown and feathery. Thorax had a faint dark inverted \"V\" shape.\r\nSpotted under bright lights near a national park.\r\nI believe this is an Endoxyla moth. My thanks to peter Marriott for confirming the genus.\r\n\r\n"

    text: Leuba - Peter Marriott says it is an Endoxyla sp. with most of these with no name.  Moths of Victoria volume 10 should assist but that is a work in progress.
