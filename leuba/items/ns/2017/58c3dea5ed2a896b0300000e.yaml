description: "A small butterfly with fawn coloured wings with iridescent blue tones near the wing bases. The wings which looked fragile could have had a span of about 15 mm.\r\nSpotted flying close to the ground over open grass land. Also present were other blues like Zizina labradus.\r\n\r\n( I believe this is Zizula hylax. Could someone confirm please. Thanks)"
