description: "This is one of the most attractive of pyralids. It sat upright resting on its legs, hlding up a recurved abdomen. Wings ( span about 15 mm) were a beautiful and rich mix of deep red and orange. The fore wings were divided into three parts with the mid section showing a dark spot near the costa. Antennae were swept back.\r\nAttracted to bright lights in the house.\r\nMy thanks to Cathy Powers for the ID."

    text: 'Leuba - from my investigations, Persicoptera aglaopa has different markings on the hindwing than your image. It has yellow with a dark band at the outer margin of the hindwing. This appears to be more like Endosimilis stilbealis - perhaps gender specific.'

    text: Thank you Cathy. I believe you are right. I found a moth very similar in colour to mine on Barcodinglife.com and it was E.stilbealis.
