description: "A brown moth with wing span about 40 mm. Thorax was covered with short dense brown setae. Fore wings were sectioned into three by thin dark jagged lines.  The hind wings were a bright orange with dark brown sub marginal area. Antennae were feathery.\r\nThis moth was high up on the wall so the photo is a little skewed. Also, could not get rid of the pesky alates that were everywhere last night.  My thanks to Cathy Powers for the ID."
