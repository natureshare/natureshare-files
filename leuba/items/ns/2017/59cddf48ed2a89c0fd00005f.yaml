description: "These were attractive thin-walled urn-shaped galls that appeared to be about 10 to 12 mm tall. The apical openings through which the adults would have emerged had jagged edges which were a deep pink. This colour bled into the pale green bodies and bases of the galls.\r\nSpotted on the upper surface of eucalyptus leaves - Gum tree species not known.\r\n"
