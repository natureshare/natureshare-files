    text: Thank you Cathy. I was hoping you'd have a look at it. This photo was taken by a friend who passed it on to me and gave me permission to use it. He saw it unfurling its wings - so a very fresh specimen !

    text: Thanks Andrew. I too think it's perhaps an Endoxyla moth.  It does look a little like yours.

    text: 'Had Peter Marriott look at this and since the Cossidae group are in a big mess as far as ID of species is concerned, he recommended the best ID would be Endoxyla spp.  Sometime down the track we may have these sorted out.  Leuba, Peter agreed that the images were of a very newly emerged specimen!'
