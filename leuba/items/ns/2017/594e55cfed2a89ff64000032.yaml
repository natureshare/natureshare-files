description: "A small silky black moth about 6 mm long with tufts of scales on the fore wings. On each fore wing was a small gold crescent, about one-third of the distance from the trailing margin. Labial palps were recurved and covered with setae. Some banding in the legs visible.\r\nSpotted under bright lights after a warm day near a national park (Dandenong Ranges)\r\nMy thanks to Cathy Powers who has identified this beauty as Bondia nigella. Family: Carposinidae\r\n( Please add Bondia nigella. Thank you.)\r\n\r\n\r\n"
