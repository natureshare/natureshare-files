description: Three clouded footman males were seen fluttering around for awhile before settling on a door frame. On closer inspection I could see one of them was successful in finding and mating with a wingless female seen here as a furry white ovoid shape with thin black bands and pale orange spots along the sides. The males were of two sizes and had distinctly pectinated antennae. The mating male can be seen head pointing downwards. Beside the female was a hairy cocoon and an empty pupal case probably recently vacated by the female. Within the hairy cage was also small wrinkled piece of skin shed by the caterpillar before pupating. Pic 3 was taken 6 days later when two of the moths had flown away and the other was clear-off the female. The female had started laying eggs seen here as minute glistening orbs. The female had the same colours as seen on the caterpillar. Will wait to see what happens next.....

    text: What a fantastic series of observations and notes. It took me a while to see that there were three males and one female.

    text: 'David, I edited this spotting, loaded 3 more photos and added to the Description. But it doesn''t seem to have worked. I can''t find the photos anywhere. Should I load them as a separate spotting and if yes, how do I link the two. Thanks'
