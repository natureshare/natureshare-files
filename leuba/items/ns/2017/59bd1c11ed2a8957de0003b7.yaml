description: "A pale moth with a wing span of about 20 mm. Each fore wing had a slightly dark patch outlined by dark flecks. Labial palps were close together, stout and recurved with dense setae at the base. Trailing fore wing margins were fringed.\r\nI need help with identifying this moth. Thanks. I have checked Oecophoridae and Gelechioidea but can't find a match ! "
