description: "A large brown paper-thin fruiting body with a ruffled upper surface and beautiful white pore surface (underside) arising from a damp log. The fruiting body had a very short stipe.\r\nSpotted in a  temperate rain forest.\r\nMy thanks to John Walter for the ID and information highlighting differences between Podoscypha and Cymatoderma.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    text: 'Hi Leuba, this  looks more like Cymatoderma elegans, it has much larger funnels than the Podoscypha and the wrinkled white underside is not seen on the Podoscypha'

    text: Thanks again John. It's so good to have the added information.  Love the dramatic underside and so pleased to have one I've never seen before. Sorry I couldn't amend the ID sooner.
