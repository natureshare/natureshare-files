description: "This slender leaf beetle was about 10 mm long. Ihad heavily pitted elytra with black, cream and purple stripes. The elytra appear to be drawn out into short spines at the apices. \r\nThe black thorax had a median ridge. Segmented antennae and the legs were black. \r\nThe beetle was resting with its body along the axis of the plant, the purplish stripes merging well with the plant.\r\nSpotted on cutting grass (Gahnia grandis)\r\n\r\n"
