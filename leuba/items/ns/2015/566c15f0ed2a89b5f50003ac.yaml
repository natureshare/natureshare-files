description: "Described as the largest and most robust of its species, this very dark male jumping spider was about 13 mm long. Fangs were large and above dark eyes was a furry brow. Palps were dark and long. Front legs were long and had faint white banding like the other legs. The abdomen had a thin white line along the anterior margin and a flattened \"x\" pattern in white. two pairs of white specks were seen in front of and posterior to the X mark.\r\nSpotted trying to catch a small fly in a local garden.
