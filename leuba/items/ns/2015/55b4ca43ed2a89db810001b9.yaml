    text: 'Hi Leuba. I am also familiar with this fungi and have known it to be Poronia erici. However, I am having trouble now finding its reference in any of the censuses, etc. It has possibly had a name change, but this is normally easy enough to track also. The concern with simply adding Poronia erici in Natureshare is not knowing how the ALA will treat this record when it is uploaded into its database. If it is ignored due to no matching name with ALA, you record is less useful than if we can get a name that matches. I''ll keep hunting for the name and ask Tom May for an update. Thanks. Chris.'

    text: Poronia erici is certainly the correct identification and the current name (even though it is not in the ALA at present). There are some issues with the fungi names in the ALA and there are still many good names for fungi that are not loaded into the names list for the ALA (the National Species List). I am working with the ALA to improve the coverage of fungi names.
