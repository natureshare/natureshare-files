description: "A net-casting spider with its blue rectangular net which was loosely slung from the front legs. The spider was prepared to get its meal at this stage. \r\nPics 2 & 3 are of the spider at day time - it was magical to see the blue net which she would have made in the evening for some supper that night. Hoping I'd be able to get an action shot next time and a shot of those enormous eyes ! \r\n\r\n"
