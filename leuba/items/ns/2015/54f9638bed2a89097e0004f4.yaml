description: "Called the \"Notched Onion-orchid\" this orchid plant was about 50 cm high. I could see a single long sheath like leaf from the centre of which rose a slender green stem bearing a spike of flowers. \r\nThe central sepal was hooded covering the petals. Lateral sepals curled backwards. The lip was bilobed with a slightly wavy margin.\r\nAt first this plant looked like it had unopened buds- the flowers were so small and are not conspicuous. They are apparently scented ! \r\nSpotted in semi-shade. "
