description: "Commonly called \"Tassel Rope-rush\", this plant was growing in a clump and would have been about a foot tall stretched out. The clumps formed mats of wiry branclets that were thick and striated (pic 2). At the nodes were what looked like brown leafy bracts. The attractive branched inflorescence looked like clumps of bracts that were coppery, plump and ovoid. \r\nThere were no sign of \"normal\" leaves. Several plants growing together gave the appearance of a tangled mat.\r\nThese plants are Dioecious and this one had male flowers.\r\nSpotted in a sclerophyll bush - part of the Cranbourne Botanical Gardens. Soil might have been a little sandy.\r\n"
