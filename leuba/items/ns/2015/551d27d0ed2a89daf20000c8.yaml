description: "These are scale insect galls seen on the adaxial side of the leaf . The broad-based conical outgrowths are female galls. There were two of these, one at the base of the leaf base and another along the main vein. the gall was purplish and had a ring near the base. One of the galls showed two openings and the other a single smooth circular orifice. Also on the leaf surface were many upright tubular structures with apical openings with crenulated margins. These were male galls and they were tinged red.\r\nSpotted on a eucalyptus tree - ? species. Nature reserve.\r\nMy thanks to Dr L.Cook for confirming genus and identifying the species.\r\n"

    text: Hi Leuba. I've added this species name to the database and included  Opisthoscelis maculata as a synonym. The ALA is yet to pick up on this new genus (published in 2010). Thanks. Chris.
