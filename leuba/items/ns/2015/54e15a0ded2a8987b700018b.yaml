description: This downy caterpillar was about 25 mm long. It had a brown and cream blotchy appearance. First pictures displaying displeasure - raised and tucked in head to display black bands and erectile horns.  After about 20 min. the caterpillar had descended the branch and was resting with its body totally camouflaged against the branch (pic 4). Spotted on young eucalyptus tree - nature reserve ( Wicks)

    text: 'Don, This was most certainly on a young eucalypt but I am not sure of the species. This plant also had several limacodid cups - Doratifera vulnerans, if that helps. We saw several caterpillars earlier but the cups sadly are always raided.'
