    text: 'Hi Leuba. This species is not part of the pauciflora complex, but rather appears to be T. ixioides or possibly the hybrid named T. truncata.'

    text: Thank you for the information Chris. I have spotted T.ixioides in the same area but it had dark spots. Is this a variant / or should I leave it at the genus level? Please advise. Thanks again.

    text: 'It can be variably spotted or even spotless. The character to concentrate on is the column, whereby here the column mid lobe has numerous sausage like glands. Hybrids of ixioides make it hard sometimes. With this one, I would go with ixioides. There a faint spots which are never present in pauciflora or nuda groups. Cheers.'
