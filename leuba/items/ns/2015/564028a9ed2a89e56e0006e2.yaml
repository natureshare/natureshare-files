description: "A small ( about 10 mm long) but attractive moth with pale yellow wings and a broad dark brown marking covering part of the thorax and extending down the inner margins of the fore wings. This moth also had a short brown streak extending down from the tornus suggesting that it was male. \r\nAntennae were thin and swept back. labial palps were brushy, yellow and bare recurved tips.\r\nSpotted resting on a leaf of an Agapanthus plant - local garden.\r\n\r\n"
