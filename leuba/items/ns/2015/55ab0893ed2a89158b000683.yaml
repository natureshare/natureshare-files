description: "Attractive clump of toffee coloured caps with slight convexity, a small discrete umbo and rolled in margins. Gills were a pale brown. these must have been covered by a thin cortina which could be seen tearing-off some of the younger caps (pic 3). The remnants of a brown spore-stained cortina could be seen as a wispy annulus around the stipe. The stipe below the annulus was a dark brown with white fibrils.\r\nSpotted groiwng as a clump on dead wood in a forest with mixed native trees."
