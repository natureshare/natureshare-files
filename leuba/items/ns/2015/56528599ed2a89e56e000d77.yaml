description: 'This dark attractive skipper had a wing span of 30 mm. The upper side of the fore wings had small rectangular patches of cream. The trailing margins also showed a narrow margin of broken cream patches. The upper side of each hind wing ( just visible) had a bright orange patch. As with most skippers, the thorax was covered with dense olive green setae. White spots were seen on a dark head.'
