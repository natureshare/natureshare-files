description: "An attractive pale brown moth with a wing span of about 20 mm. The fore wings had diffuse dark brown patches with two thin white lines in the mid-wing region and a line in the submarginal area curving towards the trailing margin and ending in a small white spot. The costa near the trailing margin also showed small white specks. Apices were pale. \r\nThe thorax showed a flash of white and this aligned with a single patch of white along the inner margin of each forewing, evident when the wings parted (pic 2).\r\nHind wings were a pale orange and appeared to have fringed margins. The dorsal aspect of the abdomen and legs were also tinged with a pale yellow.\r\nVery active moth. Spotted on a warm night under bright garden lights. Would greatly appreciate help with identification. Thanks."
