description: "This moth had a wing span of 20 mm. Typical to this species, it stood on it's front legs holding it's up-curved abdomen in the air with the apices of the fore wings resting on either side. \r\nThe wings were a mix of grey and brown with thin wavy lines. The costa had white markings down the whole length.\r\nSpotted under bright garden light. Unsure of the ID as there are a few with varying wing patterns and colour.\r\n"
