description: "This coiled thin shell with pale orange bands is that of a marine gastropod/snail that lives in a coiled tube. The snails resemble tube worms (polychaetes) because of the structure but are in a different family. The tube is usually cemented to other structures. Unlike other snails, this species does not have an operculum or lid.\r\n\r\n"

    text: How interesting! Reminds me of the tube-worm Galeolaria but it is in a completely different phylum. I would never have guessed it was a mollusc.
