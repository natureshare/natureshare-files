description: "A mollusc with a flattened body and eight distinctive overlapping plates that protect them from predators and crashing waves. This chiton was grey-green in colour, about 63 mm x 35 mm. The girdle encircling the plates had a snake-skin like appearance giving it the common name \"snakeskin chiton\".\r\nThese chitons were found along with barnacles, attached to the side of a rock in an intertidal rocky shore (Cape Conran) off the south coast of Victoria facing the Bass Strait. \r\nThis species is said to prefer rock surfaces in the mid-tide region, rather than under rocks in lower -or sub-tidal zones. \r\n"
