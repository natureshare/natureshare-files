description: "\r\nA robust mushroom with a purplish brown cap, about 40 mm wide. Some viscosity seen on cap which had a broad flattened umbo. The stipe was pale with blue longitudinal fibrils, widening at the base and then tapering. Gills were tan with a grey tint. Spore print tan with a hint of purple.\r\nSpotted growing on damp sandy soil, in leaf litter in a reserve of mixed natives.\r\n\r\n"

    text: 'I am sorry to quibble Leuba, but I do not think this is E. gelatinosum. I guess you are working on the brief description provided by Gates in the Tasmanian field guide however the complete description found in The Entolomataceae of Tasmania, Noordeloos and Gates 2012 provides further detail that excludes your find. This description notes that the pileus is "not translucently striate", the lamellae as "deeply emarginate to adnexed, ventricose, crowded", and the stipe as "tapering towards base". The pileus is clearly striate in your example and the lamellae are not deeply emarginate nor adnexed but appear to be adnate and they are not crowded. Your notes above and the images show your specimen''s stipe is widening at the base and not tapering. It is also important to note that Entoloma have pink spores not tan.'

    text: 'Hi John, Thank you for your comments and so sorry for the late response. I had no knowledge of what this fungus was so I posted all my photos on Victorian Fungi on Facebook hoping that an expert would help. Genevieve Gates had a look at it and said that it was probably E. gelatinosum because of the viscid cap. It is also frequently mistaken for a Cortinarius. Those are the exact colour of the spores - I did know that Entoloma have pink spores. I have checked other spore prints of Entoloma and they look similar to mine. The "pink" looked "tan" to me - my mistake.  I do appreciate your comments but where do we go from here ?'

      Hi Leuba, Genevieve Gates certainly knows more about Entoloma than I ever hope too and much of what I have picked up has come from her work. I recall a long discussion I had with Genevieve when in the Tarkine in Tasmania a few years ago now. The topic was the inability of fungi to conform to our ideas of species definition, or, to put it more correctly, our inability to see past the many variations in colour and form of fungi when attempting to make identifications. I agree that your spore print looked more tan than pink, but today I am viewing it on a different computer and screen and this device renders the colour as clearly pink! The general morphology indicates an Entoloma species and 'The Entolomataceae of Tasmania' lists the viscosity of the cap as a key identification feature of E. gelatinosum. Also, I have not found any other Entolomas in that publication that have a viscid cap. The most troubling part for me is the statement in the description that the pileus is "not
      translucently striate". It is quite common to state that a species is translucently striate, but it is very unusual to see a species listed as not being so, which indicates to me that this is an important feature. I have not counted exactly, but approximately 30 different collections were examined when preparing the Tassie publication on Entoloma. Have you kept the spore print? If so, perhaps we can work out a way or me to examine some of the spores under my microscope which may shed some light on this. My email address is public on Natureshare and you are welcome to contact me directly on this.

    text: 'Hello John, I have been away from this site for awhile so haven''t been able to respond. I totally agree with what you say - it is difficult to identify specimens with such scant knowledge. Unfortunately I destroyed the spore prints soon after collection. But I will remove the Id as it is misleading. Again, I appreciate your willingness to discuss this with me. I do remember where I collected this specimen and might visit the area in Winter if this Dry does not persist...thanks again.'
