description: "A dense clump of pale orange seaweed (red algae) with oak-leaf shaped fronds/thalli. \r\nWashed-up onto the beach off Westernport Bay (Balnarring Beach).\r\nThis species gets it's name \"quercifolia\" fro the oak-shaped fronds. \r\nIt is reported that this is a common and distinctive species found in deep waters in the rough-water coasts of southern Australia. \r\nMy thanks to Janine Baker for the ID. \r\n\r\n"

    text: Thuretia quercifolia added. I was surprised to discover that the Red Algae are separated from the Green and Brown Algae at the Kingdom level!

    text: Thanks David. I have to read about these everytime to refresh my memory. I have several others but might be difficult to identify them.
