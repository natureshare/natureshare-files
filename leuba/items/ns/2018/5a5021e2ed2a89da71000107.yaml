description: "A moth with a wing span of about 30 mm. It was more grey than brown with the fore wings showing a central transverse band. Each fore wing had two oblique black lines, one running from wing base downwards to the inner margin and a shorter one from the apex of each fore wing running upwards.\r\nSpotted under bright lights on a warm night in a suburban garden. Mixed native trees around. Also near a national park.\r\n I am hoping the moth will return tonight so I can get a better shot/natural light.  Thanks to Cathy Powers for confirming this as Dysbatus."

    text: Leuba - I am fairly certain that this is Dysbatus sp. 1.  The lines match the description.  It is in Moths of Victoria Part 5 and there is a CD page that details the difference between sp. 1 and D. singularis.  The light has changed the colour of the moth which is usually grey.

    text: Thank you Cathy. I was fairly certain it was Dysbatus just the oblique marking threw me. I am not able to access the CD at the moment but will have a look soon.
