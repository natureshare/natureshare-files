description: "Sea squirts/ tunicates/ascidians which appeared like clumps of collapsed \"sand-crusted\" sacs stuck to a sea fan. Each sac had two openings with scalloped edges - one on top and the other to the side (inhalant & exhalant siphons). The sacs seemed to have a reddish tinge. The inside of each sac had organs which were red in colour with a brown segment towards the base (pics 3 & 4). The organs seemed to be covered by mucilaginous substance. Commonly also called Conjevoi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
