The body pattern included small white scalloping and the central disc was a beautiful green. \r\nThe arms were well defined ending in thick rounded tips. \r\nThis sea star was about 50 mm across.\r\nSpotted in a rock pool - intertidal rocky shore (Cape Conran) facing the Bass Strait. They occur all around the Australian coast. "
