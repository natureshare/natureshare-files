description: "Caps of this bright orange mushroom were no more than 10 mm with a deep central depression. Younger fruiting bodies were almost hemispherical, flattening out as the mature. Caps showed some striation and margins were wavy. \r\nStipe was smooth and slightly paler than the cap.  Could not get a shot of the gills. Possibly Rickenella fibula."
