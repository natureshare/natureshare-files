description: 'About 20 mm long this moth had pale yellow wings with hints of copper. Wings were tented, giving the body a wedge shape. The head and anterior thorax were almost white and the paleness continued along the costa. Thoracic setae had dark tips. Feathery antennae stretched out and were almost two-thirds the body length.'
