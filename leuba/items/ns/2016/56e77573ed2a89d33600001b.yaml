description: 'Pic 1 shows the 5th instar and Pic 2, the 3rd instar of the Crusader Bug. The younger nymph had yellow bands on his legs and a small yellow band on the antennal tips. The 5th instar shows a better developed pronotum and smart bolero-like yellow wing buds. The antennal tip were completely yellow and legs completely brown by this stage. Both were seen on the same young wattle plant.'
