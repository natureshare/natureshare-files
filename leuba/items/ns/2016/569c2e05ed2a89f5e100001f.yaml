description: "These attractive beeflies were seen mating amongst leaf litter. There is clear distinction between the female and the male with the female having well separated eyes(Pic 3) and the male with large eyes together with only a thin line of separation (Pic 2). The male beefly has a single bright white spot at the base of each wing as seen in pic 2. The female has no such spots and (which is on the left-hand side) has brighter white abdominal bands and a pair of lateral tufts of white setae.\r\nSpotted in a nature reserve."

    text: I thought so too. I will post a pair of golden beeflies mating as well. The female was so much larger than the male. They are everywhere this season !
