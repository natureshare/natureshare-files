title: Birds of Eagles Lookout (Melton Reservoir)
description: 'Melton Reservoir is an artificial water storage on the Werribee River formed by the Exford Weir. It is a long winding waterway within a deep volcanic gorge, within steep dramatic escarpments on each side. The water level fluctuates widely, depending upon rainfall. In drought the water level retreats to the old river course. It is home to many waterbirds & raptors & also forms a flyway for migrating birds along the Werribee River. The steep slopes & surrounding paddocks are largely devoid of native vegetation. '
