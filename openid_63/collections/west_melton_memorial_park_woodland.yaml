title: West Melton Memorial Park woodland
description: 'This is a small (1.5 hectares) old growth Grey Box Grassy Woodland remnant through which the upper reaches of Arnolds Creek flows, enclosed within the proposed West Melton Memorial Park It is located a few hundred metres north of the northern edge of Melton, & a few hundred metres southeast of Melton Gilgai Woodland. It is surrounded on three sides by the proposed cemetery. It has about 100 large ancient Grey Box trees, many with large tree hollows, making them valuable wildlife habitat; with an understory of native grasses (as well as exotic weeds.) There are possibly 1000 Grey Box saplings, up to a metre tall. The small waterholes in the woodland fill with water after heavy rains, creating ephemeral wetlands, home to various wetland birds & frogs.'
