title: Carlsruhe Cemetery - Flora and Fauna
description: 'Image by permission from Greg and found at greg@hikingfiasco.com (other images found there as well) Carlsruhe Cemetery is located near the small rural town of Carlsruhe. It was named after a pastoral run taken up in 1837 by Charles Ebden who had completed his education at Carlsruhe, Germany. The lack of disturbance and grazing has created an oasis for native flora and fauna.'
