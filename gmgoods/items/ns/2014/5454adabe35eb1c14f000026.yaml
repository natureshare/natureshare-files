    text: 'I noticed also that B. nana var. nana is on the Little Desert species list (which is glabrous), so var. pubescens is a new species record for the Little Desert. Nearest record is Mt Arapiles. Do you have B. nana pics from other locations in the Little Desert for comparison? Loving all your uploads BTW!'
