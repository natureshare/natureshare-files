    text: 'Hi. While my first thoughts of the beetle in this pic is that it is actually Castiarina decemmaculata, I''d really need to see the pinned specimen to make a proper determination. In many cases a pic is sufficient to ID a beetle to genus, or even to species, but in many other cases the actual specimen is needed due to the similarity of many species to each other, requiring the specimen to at least be examined under a good stereo microscope, or, if necessary, by resorting to DNA analysis.'
