    text: 'Andrew, this moth is most likely Utetheisa pulchelloides.  There is another species in the genus and it is extremely difficult to tell them apart.  The Utetheisa pulchelloides is readily found in our area of Victoria.'

    text: There was a real plague of U.pulchelloides in southern Vic around that time. Thousands were also found in Tasmania right down to Hobart even though they don't breed there.  We had some good northerlies then.
