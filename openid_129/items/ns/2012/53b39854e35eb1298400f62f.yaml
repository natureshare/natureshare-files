    text: Not sure of ID to C. tomentella but the raised/conspicuous midrib on the leaf underside and a habit that looks rhizomatous suggest C. tomentella. There are four species of Celmisia recorded at Mt Hotham and all are hard to distinguish.

    text: 'The silvery upper leaf surface suggests it might not be tomentella but this along with the spreading, carpet-like habit suggests C. costiniana.'
