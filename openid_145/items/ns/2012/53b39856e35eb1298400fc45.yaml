    text: "Hello Jodi.  \r\nI believe your beetle is Paropsisterna decolorata. \r\nHere is a link which illustrates both species. (You will need to click on the large image repeatedly to see all 21 images) \r\nhttp://www.padil.gov.au/pests-and-diseases/pest/main/135776# \r\nParopsisterna decolorata has \r\n1/ Larger marbling (dots) on the elytra.\r\n2/ Pronotum pattern has an inverted 'u' shape.\r\n3/ Flaring (light colors, four dots in this case)  occurs from the base (where it adjoins the pronotum) of the elytra.\r\nBoth species are very variable and easy to confuse.
