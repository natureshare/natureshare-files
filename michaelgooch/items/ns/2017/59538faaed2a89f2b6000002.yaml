description: 'This bird is in breeding colour... much brighter orange-rufous than the colours of the Red-necked Stint - I have left the Red-necked Stints in for comparisons. In the primary picture you can also see the white ''line'' across the mantle (upper back) of which the two lines from the rear appear as a loose V and is one of the diagnostic features of a Little Stint.
