    text: "Hello.  Your beetle discovery is the same as one that I found years ago.\r\nI had called mine C. dorsalis but have changed the name based on images on ALA.  \r\n Chondropyga gulosa has a narrow stripe along the elytral suture, two lateral stripes and broad pronotal stripe.  \r\nChondropyga dorsalis has a wide stripe on the suture running through the pronotum.\r\nI believe my misidentification is the odd one out and possibly Reiner Richter has copied my error.  Please consider the two species' images and consider if yours is also the different species. \r\nhttp://bie.ala.org.au/species/urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:11f1b7a1-4a01-4a57-8b38-e095693729d2#tab_gallery \r\nhttp://bie.ala.org.au/species/urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:15f068c9-0bc1-4bd5-9b76-da867b0ffb50#tab_gallery \r\n"
