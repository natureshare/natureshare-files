    text: 'Yeah I think if we have some landscapes with species identified in them then it shows the kind of environment the species live in (as well as eg the shape of the leaf). Even for the "survey" type observations you have put up, a single photo representative of the landscape and environment is good too. Ie it might show everything dry from summer of covered in snow!'
