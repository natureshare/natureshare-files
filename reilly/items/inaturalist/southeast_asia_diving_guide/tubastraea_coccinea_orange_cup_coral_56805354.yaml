description: 'Orange cup coral (Tubastraea coccinea) belongs to a group of corals known as large-polyp stony corals. This non-reef building coral extends beautiful translucent tentacles at night, which gives the species its nickname, the sun coral. Tubastraea coccinea is heterotrophic and does not contain zooxanthellae in its tissues as most corals do.'
