description: "The titan triggerfish, giant triggerfish or moustache triggerfish (Balistoides viridescens) is a large species of triggerfish found in lagoons and at reefs to depths of 50\_m (160\_ft) in most of the Indo-Pacific, though it is absent from Hawaii. With a length of up to 75 centimetres (30\_in), it is the largest species of triggerfish in its range (the stone triggerfish, Pseudobalistes naufragium, from the east Pacific is larger)."
