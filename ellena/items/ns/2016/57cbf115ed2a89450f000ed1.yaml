description: i was walking along the road with Lydia and i saw something move in the corner of my eye.... i couldn't believe it!!! IT WAS A PENGUIN! at the time i was at The Nobbies and not far from the display centre. The penguin was inside its burrow. We were very very quiet and careful. I managed to get this photo with my Nanna's phone.
