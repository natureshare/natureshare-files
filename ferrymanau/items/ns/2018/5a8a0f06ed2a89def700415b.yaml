    text: 'On mossy ground, and after heavy dew I have had lots of birds you would not normally see on the ground, happily feeding and maybe getting some moisture also. At the end of last year I had a group of ~40 Pardalotes (mostly Striated with some Spotted also), a few Fuscous and Yellow-tufted Honeyeaters and seven Flame Robins all within a small area of about 20sqm. Amazing to watch.'

    text: 'At what location, Michael? It was the fact that it was a Honeyeater that surprised me. The Eastern Spinebill is very common here (top of Mt. Macedon) where there are plenty of blossoms to feed on'
