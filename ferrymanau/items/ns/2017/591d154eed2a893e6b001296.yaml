    text: 'Original id was Lepista nuda - this looks quite similar, but there are very fine fibrils on the mid stipe that have caught some of the rusty brown spore deposit, and same on the bulb at the base of the stipe - which fits Cortinarius better. Beautiful, but cannot pin down to particular species.'
