description: 'This female has laid eggs on her coccoon. The caterpillars will hatch and eat the coccoon first and then either stay on the plant that the female made her coccoon on if it is to their taste, or try thier luck and balloon to wherever the wind takes them. The female dies shortly after laying her eggs. We had masses of these caterpillars feeding on the Indigofera australis in our front yard during 2014 and 2015.'
