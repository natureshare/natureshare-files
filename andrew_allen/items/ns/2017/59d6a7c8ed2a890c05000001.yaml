description: 'Strange looking wasp mimic. When I first saw it, it was flying between flowers, and in flight it looked like a gasteruptiid or ichneumon wasp with a similar style of flying. It was quite quick and difficult to photograph, but after a while it stayed still and I got a few photos. The face looks like a longicorn beetle. Until I got a photo of the face, I thought it was a wasp. After a bit of google searching I think this is Enchoptera apicalis.'

    text: 'Tony D. on BB says that Enchotera apicalis has a laterally smooth pronotum, rather longish ''snout'', and last antennal segments pale. This seems to fit your observation.'
