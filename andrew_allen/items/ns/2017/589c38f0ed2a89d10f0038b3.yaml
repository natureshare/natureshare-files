    text: 'The ALA seems to have a lot of quite different spiders under the name of Araneus circulissparsus and I think some must be misidentified. I look forward to the Araneus group being revised as it seems to be a "dumping ground"    for many species. However, observations by Donald Hobern and Russell Best match yours and I am confident that their ids are well-researched- so I agree with your id.'
