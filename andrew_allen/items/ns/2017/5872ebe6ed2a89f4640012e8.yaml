    text: 'Andrew, it certainly looks like a Plecia sp. I can''t find a Bibionid with the distinctive white stripes on the abdomen and the black spot behind the head. Your photos are so detailed that Ken Walker or Tony Daley would probably be able to nail the exact species. Are you able to upload your photos to Bowerbird.org.au where you should get a response from them?'

    text: 'A great find, Andrew. Only two records for Victoria in the ALA - Musgrave 1932 and Hermit 2015, both in the Grampians. This is a very unusual "monotypic" species. Great to have such clear photos of the species in NS. We can be excused for thinking it was a Bibionid fly as this also tricked Ken W.'
