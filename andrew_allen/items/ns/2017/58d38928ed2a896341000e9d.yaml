description: '6 photos included. I''ve been going back to the same place for about a month now specifically to see how some caterpillars that I first saw as hatchlings would develop. Today at the exact same place as previous observations I found three Comocrus behri. But I also found about 10 caterpillars that looked exactly the same as the last time I saw them. Either they haven''t moulted yet, or they aren''t Comocrus behri and finding these three in the exact same spot is a miraculous coincidence. I will return for another look soon... Edit: It turns out that it was an amazing conincidence, as the caterpillars I had been following were Delias aganippe.'
