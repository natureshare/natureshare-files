description: 'Large-ish wasp collecting mud for a nest. About five seen around the edges of the dam. Quite timid and tricky to photograph! After a bit of a search I''ve attempted an ID with Sceliphron laetum based on the facial features seen on the photo and this information here: http://museum.wa.gov.au/research/collections/terrestrial-zoology/entomology-insect-collection/entomology-factsheets/sceliphron'
