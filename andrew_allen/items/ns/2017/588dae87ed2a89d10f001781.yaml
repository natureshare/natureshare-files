description: 'Mostly foraging through the flowers, although it also spent some time amongst the foliage. My third visit in two days to the same flowering tree which is attracting a lot of insects! The orange wings make me think Cryptocheilus sp. '

    text: 'Yes, possibly/likely Cryptocheilus sp. but no exact match on NS, ALA and BB. To be safe you could leave it as Pompilidae (family) or take a chance on Cryptocheilus sp.  I just read that it is estimated there are just as many species of Pompilids undescribed as described.'
