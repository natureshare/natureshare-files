description: 'Orange Chat, Lake Tutchewop, November 2015. A tricky bird to find, and quite shy as well. This was the best photo I could manage, heavily cropped and taken at a fair distance. I''m adding some bird photos for species that I have photoraphed in Victoria that haven''t yet been recorded on NatureShare.'
