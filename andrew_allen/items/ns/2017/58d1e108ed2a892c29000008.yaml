description: 'Beach Stone-curlew, September 2014. A well known and heavily twitched bird at the time, and a rare record for Victoria. A Beach Stone-curlew, possibly the same individual, was observed in a nearby location for about a week in 2016. I''m adding some bird photos for species that I have photoraphed in Victoria that haven''t yet been recorded on NatureShare.'

    text: Fantastic record and photo for NS of a rarely seen bird. I updated the bird taxonomy to Christidis & Boles (2008) only last week and this was one of the species that had a species name change.
