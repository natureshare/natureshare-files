description: 'Scarlet Honeyeaters have irrupted into Victoria this spring, and have been recorded in many places that they have never been seen in before. It was great to find two at my local patch, which is probably not the right habitat for these at all. Wikipedia has an interesting article on irruption https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irruptive_growth'

    text: 'Pied Honeyeaters are nomadic and a few have been seen around northern Victoria this spring, e.g. Goschen, Murray-Sunset NP. It would be very worthwhile to try and get some photos as they rarely some further south. '
