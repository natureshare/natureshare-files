description: 'This small spider was quite difficult to photograph as the wind was blowing it around a lot. It looked like a tiny silver bead. At first I thought that it was some type of debris that had ended up in the web. The photos do not really show just how shiny and silver it was. I''m pretty sure the ID is Argyrodes antipodianus reference: https://bie.ala.org.au/species/urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:5fe30d41-1ca3-4293-92c2-3a5891b8e3fb'
