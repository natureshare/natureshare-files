description: 'There were type types of Rhinotia sp. weevils around this morning. The ones with white markings on their back I think are Rhinotia hemisticta. The plain ones, like this, to my eyes seem to have slightly ''fatter'' front legs, although they may also be Rhinotia hemisticta. I don''t know if this variablility is within the same species or denotes a different species.'
