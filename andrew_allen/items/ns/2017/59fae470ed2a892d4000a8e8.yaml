description: 'I drove to Newstead this afetrnoon to see the pair of Barking Owls that have been reported recently. They have been heavily twitched all week. I haven''t given the exact location for these as they are quite rare and endangered in Victoria, although it''s becoming fairly common knowledge amongst birders. It appears to be regurgitating a pellet. '
