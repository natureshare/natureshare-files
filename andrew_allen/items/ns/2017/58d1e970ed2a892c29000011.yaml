description: 'Australian Painted Snipe (male), Altona, January 2014. A heavily twitched bird at the time. Very shy, only came out of reeds for a few seconds on a few occasions each day. Stayed around for about 3 days. I''m adding some bird photos for species that I have photoraphed in Victoria that haven''t yet been recorded on NatureShare.'
