description: 'Lewin''s Rail, Western Treatment Plant, June 2016. A shy, secretive, rarely seen and seldom photographed species. This one stayed around the "Crake Pond" at the T-section for about two weeks, and was well photographed by quite a few people! I''m adding some bird photos for species that I have photoraphed in Victoria that haven''t yet been recorded on NatureShare.'
