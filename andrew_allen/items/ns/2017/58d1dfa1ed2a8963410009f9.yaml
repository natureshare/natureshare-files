description: 'I think the common name is now Pacific Koel, which are becoming more common summer migrants around Victoria in recent years. There has been a koel at the Melbourne Botanic Gardens for several years in a row now. I''m adding some bird photos for species that I have photoraphed in Victoria that haven''t yet been recorded on NatureShare.'
