description: 'Edit: I originally had these as Eurymeloides pulchra, as there were a few adult E. pulchra nearby, but I have been informed via Facebook when I shared this image that these are Eurymeloides punctata. I have compared with E. pulchra that I photographed here https://natureshare.org.au/observations/583d4f24ed2a897480005e60?species=Eurymeloides+pulchra and also images found online - the early instars are similar but E. punctata appear darker and brighter with slightly different markings as shown in this photo and e.g. here http://www.brisbaneinsects.com/brisbane_planthoppers/PunctataHoppe.htm and here https://sites.google.com/site/insectsoftasmaniahemiptera/suborder-auchenorrhyncha/cicadellidae-leafhoppers/genus-eurymeloides/eurymeloides-punctata'
