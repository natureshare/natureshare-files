description: 'I saw this small insect flying around a black wattle. It was fast and difficult to photograph, and at first I thought it was a lycid beetle. I managed to get a few photos before it flew away. When I zoomed into the photo I noticed the moth-like legs and googled lycid mimic moth to discover that it is indeed a moth. I think possibly Snellenia lineata, but I''m not exactly sure of the species to I have left it as Snellenia sp. for now. A fascinating mimic, complete with lycid like antennae. Lycid beetles are poisonous so it seems advantageous to mimic them. Two photos uploaded.'

    text: Andrew - I am so jealous.  I keep taking images of the beetle and never get the moth.  Great images and I think you ID of Snellenia lineata is correct.  The only other possibility would be S. hylaea but I know that S. lineata has been observed in Upper Beaconsfield previously.  I would put the species as lineata.
