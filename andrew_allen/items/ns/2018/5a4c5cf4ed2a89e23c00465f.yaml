    text: 'Maybe you could confirm with martin lagerway, but judging from his bowerbirds posts I would say it is almost certainly Dicranosterna immaculata. In the post http://www.bowerbird.org.au/observations/79823 he says that there are only two common species in victoria, and although the larva look similar immaculata is the only one which occurs on acacia with bipinate leaves, eg the black wattle shown in your photo.'
