description: 'Sorry about the poor quality heavily cropped photos! During a quick visit to WHP yesterday afternoon I saw this butterfly flying around. After watching and following it for a while, it landed about six metres up a tree and I was finally able to get some distant photos. I have had a go at ID and I''m fairly sure it''s a female Ogyris abrota (dark purple azure). There were quite a few patches of mistletoe in the area, which is the host plant for the caterpillars of this species. A rare butterfly and a lucky find!'
