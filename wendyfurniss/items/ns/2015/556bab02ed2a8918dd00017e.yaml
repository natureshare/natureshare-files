    text: 'Sorry I can''t agree with David. This is a Russulaceae, Russula genus, possibly Russula persanguinea as we can see a pure white stipe with a slight flare towards the base. It is more important though to see shots of the gills and the whole stipe to be certain of species. (I know  knees might complain so sometimes a compact mirror is handy to place underneath) '
