title: Beetles - Leaf Beetle reference collection
description: 'Leaf beetles are a large and varied group.  They feed on leaves and their larvae feed on leaves.  From almost microscopic flea beetles to huge tortoise leaf beetles that mimic leaf galls and tuck their toes and antennae under their hemispherical shell, they are sometimes rare but sometimes serious pests for farming and forestry.  They are sometimes of assistance for biological control of introduced weeds.   This collection is an attempt to name the larger species so you have some hope in finding a name when you encounter one.  '
