    text: "Hi Martin. I've added Nambouria spp. Haven't been able to find the name N. xanthops on any Australian directory, but I'll keep trying. Perhaps you can point me in the right direction.\r\nCheers. Chris."

    text: "Chris.  It seems from ALA that there is only one species.   They have three sightings of Nambouria, one of which is mine.  http://bie.ala.org.au/species/urn:lsid:biodiversity.org.au:afd.taxon:363b1d9e-1688-4de8-80b5-9a90420f6472#tab_classification \r\nMy species name came from here, and this is supposed to originate from Australia.  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1440-6055.2002.00257.x/abstract;jsessionid=6DAF11C127AFF430F2ED2906408C9648.d03t02 \r\nWith this uncertainty, I do not think we can assign a a species name.
