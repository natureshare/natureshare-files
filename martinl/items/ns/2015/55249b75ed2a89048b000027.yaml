description: This beetle is Peltoschema perplexa.  I have determined this by comparison of its consistent pattern with the museum of Victoria collection.  This beetle seems to be scarce and I have seen it only twice.  Peltoschema is a genus of Acacia feeders and this one seems to occur on the small leafed wattle illustrated.  Maybe someone knows the species.  Christmas Hills has a population of these wattles and we found many beetles that day
