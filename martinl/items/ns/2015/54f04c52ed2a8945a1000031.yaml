description: 'Trachymela are gnarled and highly textured beetles in brown colors.  They are sometimes referred to as ''gumnut'' leaf beetles on the presumption that they might mimic gumnuts.    This beetle has sinuous ridges meandering over the elytra and with a small black dot near the forward half of the elytra.   '
