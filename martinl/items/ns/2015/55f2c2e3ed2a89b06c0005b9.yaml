description: 'This species is Peltoschema basicollis.  This orange beetle with black spots is clearly a coccinellidae mimic.  These beetles are monophagous, obligate feeders on Acacia buxifolia and the beetles were restricted to a small stand of this acacia in a small section of the park.  These are easily and commonly mistaken for ladybirds but feature a black suture.    There are at least three species of Peltoschema in a complex of ladybird mimic species.  '
