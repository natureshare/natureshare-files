description: 'This beetle is uniquely lacking any of the normal red pigmentation.  It was found nearby a normally colored specimen which is my previous observation.  The patterning of the elytra with a ring of six small marks on the apical half of the elytra is completely consistent for Paropsisterna annulus.  '
