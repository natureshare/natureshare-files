    text: Hi Martin. Wondering why you think this is a Symphyta sp.? I can find no pics of it using that keyword on the web. I ask because I saw one today too. Cheers.

    text: 'Symphyta is the subfamily of sawflies and not a genus taxon.  I copied that name from the database when it popped up as I types in ''sawfly''  I think it is in the Perga genus (steelblue sawfly).  I am awaiting confirmation.   '

    text: 'Hi Martin, Have a look at this sawfly observation - http://natureshare.org.au/observations/53b3985ae35eb12984010b68?species_search[name]=Pergagrapta+turneri    Do you think that yours looks similar?  I think my observation was identified on Bowerbird, but must have forgotten to write that on the observation.'

    text: 'Thank you Suzanne.  You are welcome to make the ID change on my sighting.  I was looking elsewhere but Ken has just determined on bowerbird that it is Pergagrapta.  '

    text: 'As you will see, I changed your I.D. to Pergagrapta spp., but you may be able to identify it further.  I see that Russell''s Pergagrapta turneri does not have the red on the thorax that mine has either, so maybe that species are variable in that regard - I just don''t know. '
