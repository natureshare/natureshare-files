description: 'This is Paropsisterna spp.  It belongs in the interlita group but not sure the species.   It looks like one that Russel Best has photographed in his lawn.  http://natureshare.org.au/observations/53b3985ae35eb12984010d2c?species=Paropsisterna+spp.&tag=   It is related to Paropsisterna intacta, an under bark nocturnal species.  It features foveae (small dimples) in the sides of the pronotum, emphasized in this case by a black dot.     I have seen this only once before at Taggerty on a small shrub.  Found on a messmate eucalyptus.  Seems to be diurnal'
