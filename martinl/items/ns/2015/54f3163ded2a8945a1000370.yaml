description: 'This beetle is Paropsis erudita.  It is a highly nitid (glossy) species found under bark of smooth barked eucalyptus spp. such as manna gum.  This is the more scarce of the nocturnal leaf beetles in my experience and found only twice.  Also seen at Wonga Park (Mt Lofty) and Healesville.   It lacks striae grooves and puncturation is very fine.  There are two very smart looking red diagonal lines on the combined elytra in the form of a chevron.  '
