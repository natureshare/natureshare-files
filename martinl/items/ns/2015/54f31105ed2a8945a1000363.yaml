description: 'This beetle is Paropsisterna beata.  It is a highly nitid  (glossy) species and lacking striae grooves.  The combined elytra have six orange dots.  The orange edge of the elytra and pronotum is important to note for ID purpose to avoid possible confusion with other similar species.  Several specimens were found communally under a smooth barked Eucalyptus sp. which looks similar to a manna gum.   This is a nocturnal species in Victoria but also occurs in northern states and appears to be diurnal there.   I have never seen it except under bark.  I have observed this species also in Mt Lofty (Wonga Park, Vic), Frankston, Croydon and the Basin.   '
