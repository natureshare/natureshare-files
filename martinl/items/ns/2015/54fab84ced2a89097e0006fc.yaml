    text: 'G''day Martin. Have added this one''s name. I have some land in the Mallee, so will look out for this one. Does it prefer a particular species of eucalypt?'

    text: 'I don''t know what eucalypt it prefers.  I''ve seen it only once and it has very few records so it would be a great one to find again.  There are several Paropsis and Paropsisterna species to find in the western district where the habitat is quite different.  I do well looking on new growth, and at the edges of forest habitat and I like roadside plantations.   In Melbourne I have done well on red box.    '
