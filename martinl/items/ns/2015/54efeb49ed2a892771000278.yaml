description: "This beetle is Paropsisterna atalanta.  A rotund and mottled leaf beetle with its widest part towards the rear.  This beetle was found on Eucalyptus.  It is variable beetle and this example demonstrates  the black marks that are usually present on the apex of the elytra and also at the base (forward) near the suture (centre line of the elytra).  \r\nI have seen this beetle also at Frazer NP (Eildon) and Anglesea.
