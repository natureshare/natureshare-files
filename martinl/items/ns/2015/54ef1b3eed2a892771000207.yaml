description: Paropsisterna semifumata.  This small beetle is a riparian species and feeds only on white Callistemon spp.? growing in creeks and rivers along the eastern coast of Australia up to Brisbane.   I've seen it both times that I've looked at this reserve but its probably common enough along Jacksons Creek wherever you find Callistemon.   Semi + fumata translates in Latin to half + smokey.
