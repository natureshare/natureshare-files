    text: 'Thanks Chris.  It is a magnificent beetle.  I suspect that the yellow colors are early in the season and orange/red come later.  We need more sightings to check this suspicion.  Next time in Bright, Hotham, Falls Creek, Buller, in the summertime, you can find one.  They would also be in Kosciusko.  '
