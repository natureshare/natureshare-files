description: 'Peltoschema orphana is the most common leaf beetle found on Acacia, usually silver wattle.  Commonly called the fireblight beetle it can cause devastation to silver wattle populations and even kill trees by defoliation.  This versatile little beast is polyphagus and was feeding, with several others, and their larvae, on Eucalyptus which is uncommon but has been recorded before.'
