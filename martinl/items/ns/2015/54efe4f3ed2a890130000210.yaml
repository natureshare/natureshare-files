description: 'This is Paropsisterna hectica. A golden/green leaf beetle, sometimes with a red pigment extending from the base of the elytra. This species occurs from NSW to Victoria. A Tasmanian species is golden, rather than green and called Paropsisterna aurea. The Tasmanian beetle is still considered a different species but they are quite identical to this golden one and probably all belong to Paropsisterna hectica and will become synonomized in due course. This is found on Snow Gum (White Sallee). Also found in Licola.'
