description: "Paropsisterna sp.  This bright green beetle has variable red on the shoulders and sometimes covering the entire elytra.  There is some red across the head and sometimes extending through the pronotum.   Seen in Wonga Park, Glenburn and Eildon.   Also in Tasmania.\r\nI have, on suggestion removed the P. laesa title as this beetle has striae puncturations in very regular lines and laesa is very irregular in its pattern as seen in the pinned specimen of laesa.
