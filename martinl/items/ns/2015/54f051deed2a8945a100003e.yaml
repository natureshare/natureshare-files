description: 'This beetle is a small yellow leaf beetle which seems similar to Paropsisterna variicollis.  The elytral striae have a series of puncturations each with a small black dot.  These were only seen in a single location.  This beetle is illustrated on PaDIL from where I have derived the identification.  http://bie.ala.org.au/species/Paropsisterna+inspersa#tab_gallery '
