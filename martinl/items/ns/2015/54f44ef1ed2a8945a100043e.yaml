description: 'This beetle is small and green with a somewhat constant pattern of red zone along the elytra usually laterally and usually leaving a green stripe dorsally.   The pronotum is green and usually unmarked or weakly marked with white patterns.  I suspect this is might be P. obovata but lack confidence in this designation. '
