description: "This beetle is always dark.  Close inspection will reveal that it comes in at least two varieties, one entirely black.\r\nThe second variety has subtle red lines on the elytra.  Another (rare) has brown elytra.  This beetle is common and widespread along the east coast including Tasmania.  It always has very fine and virtually imperceptible striae puncturations. It has strong foveae on the pronotum (dimples in its cheeks).     \r\nThese are crepuscular and found most easily under bark of candlebark/manna gum types which offer large spaces for them to hide.
