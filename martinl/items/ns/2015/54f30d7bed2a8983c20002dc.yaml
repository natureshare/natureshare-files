description: "This is Paropsisterna lineata, a mostly black and highly nitid (glossy) beetle with a few consistent yellow lines along the striae.  This is a nocturnal species and found in the daytime hiding in the gaps in stringy-bark bark.  I have not found it on other species of eucalyptus.   I have not found it except under bark.  Also seen in Croydon, Ferntree Gully, the Basin and Tasmania.  \r\n"
