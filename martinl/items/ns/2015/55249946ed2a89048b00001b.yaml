description: "This leaf beetle is vegetarian but easily mistaken for its mimicry model, the carnivorous spotted ladybird beetle.  This one is sometimes mis-identified in photographic images and pinned collections.  \r\nLeaf beetles have long antennae and ladybirds are very short and slightly knobbed in that department.  This beetle has four pronotal spots (usually) and once you notice this, you will hardly be fooled by this devious copycat beetle.     "
