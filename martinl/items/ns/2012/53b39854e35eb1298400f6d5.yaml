    text: 'The taxon Procrisina has recently been synomized with Paropsis and is now a valid but not a current name.  It is an anomalous species, not fitting easily into the Paropsis genus, nor the Paropsisterna genus.  It feeds on tea tree and Kunzea and despite once thinking it is a scarce species, I now know it to be very common in some places.  picti + pennis in Latin means painted + wings.'
