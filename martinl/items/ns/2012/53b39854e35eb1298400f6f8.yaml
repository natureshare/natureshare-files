description: 'This is Peltoschema suturalis.  This acacia leaf beetle seems to prefer broad leaf acacia and was found on Golden Wattle.   This is the largest Peltoschema species that I am aware of.  The name derives from the red line extending the length of the elytral suture.  The species is not always green but can be yellow, as is also the case for P. orphana (fireblight beetle) and several similar species.   .  '
