    text: "Mark, that is bound to be right.  I used the name eriococcidae which is the family name years ago before I understood what I was talking about.  You are welcome to add the correct name.  Here is a link to Lynn Cook  whom I am certain that you know of, and her slideshow of 40 images of the species in this genus which you might not have found yet ... a great insight into her work.   \r\nhttp://www.lyncook.org/Lyn_Cook/Apiomorpha.html "
