description: On roadside Acacia pycnantha (probably planted). Probably Araneus talipedatus but also fits reasonably well with the genera Peucetia and Oxypodes (Oxyopidae family).

    text: Thanks Suzanne. It looks right but I can't find anything with markings remotely like mine. Was there a specific source you found?

    text: 'Not really, just the general ''look'' of the spider.  I searched on the internet, but didn''t find anything with those markings either.  But, searching through my books, it does look very similar (apart from the darker patches on the abdomen) to a photo on page 47 of the Steve Parish Wild Australia Guide to Spiders.  To quote from "The Private Life of Spiders", "Lynx spiders have a noticeably pointed abdomen, a dome-shaped cephalothorax and legs with numerous spines standing out at right angles." The book, "Spiders, the Ultimate Predators" states "Most can be identified by their heavily spined legs, rather slim, pointed abdomen, high-domed head and eye arrangement". '

    text: 'Yes, you are right.  Looks almost the same as the fifth photo of the female Araneus talipedatus on the Arachne website.  I hadn''t realized that Araneus could have such spiky leg hairs.  Pity we can''t see the arrangement of the eye pattern.'
