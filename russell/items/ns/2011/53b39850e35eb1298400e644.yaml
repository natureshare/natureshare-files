    text: 'This beetle is in the genus Paropsisterna many of which show off rows of shiny beading or marbling on the elytra.  We are getting closer!  It is similar to Paropsisterna decolorata but smaller than the normal form.  Being smaller is not to necessarily exclude that species but it is very likely a different species which I cannot yet find a name for.   '
