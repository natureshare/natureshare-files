    text: From Ken Walker "Hi Russell -- I just checked our collection and we do not have a single specimen from Victoria -- all from NSW and QLD. That Mallacoota area is usually about 5 degrees warmer than the rest of Victoria due to the easterly weather patterns that flow down the east coast. There are a number of species that only enter Victoria in that area. Good record. Cheers Ken"
