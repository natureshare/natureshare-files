    text: 'Everything fits with previous finds ... dry, wildflower area; flowers variable in size but mostly very small compared to subsp. armeria; leaves hairy and short; overall plant short (with one exception)  compared to the long-leaved, large-flowered, 1m+ tall subsp. armeria plants nearby. Again, the two subspp. never cross re distribution. 11371 shows nearest subsp. armeria plants.'

    text: subsp. pilosifolium now seems to be found over most of the north-facing slope of Mt Charlie including the lower areas. I haven't noticed them this low down before.
