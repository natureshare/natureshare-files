    text: Good sighting. Are Satin Flycatchers increasing their range in the Macedon Ranges as gullies in eucalypt forests are becoming more heavily vegetated over the last year or so?

    text: 'Hi David. This is the only encounter I''ve had with this species so the only facts I can state are that this bird wasn''t here for the 10 years prior (during the drought), an understorey of shrubs has flourished over the past three years), and this bird arrived at my place a year or so ago. I''ve not heard it anywhere else on my travels through the Macedon Range.'
