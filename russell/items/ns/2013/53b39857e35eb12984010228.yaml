    text: 'Hi Russell. APC is considering this synonymous with B. cinerea. The VBA has not included this name either. For consistency with VBA and APC, should the name remain as B. cordifolia for now? Thanks.'

    text: You might want to follow this up with Ian Thompson since he did the Bossiaea work. I assume I implemented the relevant Vic stuff into NS.

    text: 'Have checked APC for species added by Ian Thompson, including B. sericea and B. alpina. Have now added both of these to NS database, along with B. distichoclada. Will ask Ian about B. cordifolia.'
