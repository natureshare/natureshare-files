    text: 'Dr Leigh Winsor says "Mr H. R. Hogg was a keen naturalist who had a property at Mt Macedon, which is the type locality for this species. The species occurs in south central Victoria and extending eastwards to the highlands. There is another species of similar appearance, C. sulphureus in which the inner paired stripes are narrower than the outer pair and are usually all black - in C. hoggii the inner pair are broader and generally exhibit a green colour with a touch of indigio, than the outer pair."'
