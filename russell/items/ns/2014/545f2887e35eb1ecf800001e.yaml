    text: Thanks Chris. I didn't know where to start. Your Xanthosia suggestion led me to the Xanthosia species known at the Grampians and X. tasmanica looks a good possibility too. X. huegellii flowers seem to be yellowish whereas X. tasmanica seems more pinkish.

    text: X. tasmanica from Anglesea in not very hairy and leaf more divided I think. Worth a look though.

    text: 'The pic here shows lower leaves that are glabrescent while the upper leaves (new growth?) are very hairy. This seems to match with pics I can find of tasmanica. It is a new plant so hard to tell. All this would fit with both huegellii or tasmanica using the FoV key. I didn''t take the best of pics but I''d say the umbel is 2- or 3-flowered, which tends towards tasmanica perhaps (although huegellii is also 3-6-flowered!).'

    text: "Here is a useful paper: https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/73194/Tel8Hae441.pdf\r\nThe key weighs heavily on leaflet shape, with your photo tending more towards X. tasmanica I would say. A correct assignment would be to call it Xanthosia pusilla spp. agg."
