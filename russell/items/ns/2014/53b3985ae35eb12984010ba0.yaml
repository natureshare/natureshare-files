    text: 'ID by KD who added it "has an unusual sexbrand but I take this highlight-effect to be linked to wing wear. Your adult''s is shorter than the sexbrand of reitmanni which it superficially resembles though. The brand in doubledayi is straight so that eliminates that species (it is not straight). The brand length matches well with T. andersoni but appears slightly more wavy than is typical for that butterfly, but that aside I take it to be that species on good belief."'
