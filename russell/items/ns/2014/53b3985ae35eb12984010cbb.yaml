    text: "This beetle is Paropsisterna semifumata (= half + smoky) .  They are riparian and feed on the white callistemon foliage that grow in creeks.  \r\nNice find"

    text: 'Thanks Martin. This was a riparian find, being alongside the Lerderderg River. There would have been plenty of the white-flowering Callistemon sieberi at this location too.'

    text: 'It is fascinating to consider the dependency of monophagus insects on their host plants along with the plant distribution.  This dependency is most extreme among Chrysomelidae (also Hemiptera and probably Hymenoptera).  I find this beetle reliably at Organ Pipes NP on Jacksons Creek and you have named the C. sieberi correctly.  I found the same beetle at Licola in the Macalister River on the same plant and am aware of sightings in Sydney and Brisbane.   The huge number of species of beetles (350,000 species) is contributed in no small part to the speciation of their host plants.'
