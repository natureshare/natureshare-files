    text: 'Dr Leigh Winsor says "it is one of the few local flatworms to be found out and about during the day, usually in overcast conditions, suggesting that its colour is a warning colour and that the species may be toxic to would-be predators. The type locality for the species is Macedon, not far from where this specimen was photographed."'
