    text: 'Hi Leuba, this one is quite a strong climber with tiny flowers. It is very common and I''ve seen it at many places but this is the first time I''ve seen flowers open. The fruit are greenish and globular and are often called snotty-gobbles! Cassytha are also well known as host plants for some butterflies, e.g. Candalides hyacinthus.'
