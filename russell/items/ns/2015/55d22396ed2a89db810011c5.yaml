description: 'Location is where this species was discovered for Victoria in 2011, until now the only population known in Victoria. The plant in the first two pics was in dry soil at the outer edge of a gilgai and exposed to full sun. This made this plant a little depauperate. This plant also had the best flower at this location. Plants were found both sides of the track in the numerous small depressions/gilgais, always at the outer edge of the depression.'
