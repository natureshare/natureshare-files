description: 'Foliage is quite flexible, with a slight sharpness to the tip. Growing on a cliff face / escarpment with fully grown Bursaria, Callitris and other fully grown plants. I mention fully grown because the attached (3 plants seen) was 50cm tall by 1m wide (possibly a bit less). Plants were very woody so probably old. There are no plants above the escarpment, which was Grey Box with wildflower understorey. There are no grevilleas recorded anywhere near here. It is a form of rosmarinifolia.'
