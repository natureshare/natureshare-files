title: 'Mt Teneriffe FLORA, Riddells Creek'
description: 'Flora of Mt Teneriffe, from and including Mt Charlie Rd. The damp forest southern side is contradicted by the dry, loose, shaly wildflower area on the north side. Some areas are dominated by a Hakea decurrens ''thicket''. The main area of Mt Teneriffe is protected and owned by Trust for Nature. Initial species list (160) comprised Ian Lunt''s survey post-183 bushfires, TFN surveys (mostly Chris Lindorff) and two surveys by Russell Best in 2011. Most of these appear to be ''out-of-season'' because they lack springtime lilies and orchids.'
