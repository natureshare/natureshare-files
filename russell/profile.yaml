  In memory of Russell Best (1963 - 2015)

  The co-founder of NatureShare and the biggest contributor of species information, observations, photos, collections and identifications. Russell travelled widely in Victoria in search of native, rare and threatened plants.

  He inspired the creation of this free and open site and provided the invaluable ideas and discussion to make this a useful storage and sharing system for his own extensive knowledge, that of his friends in the Riddells Creek Landcare and Australian Plants Society (Keilor Plains) groups, and of the wider community of nature enthusiasts.

  Russell was a tireless and enthusiastic promotor of NatureShare and brought many contributors and experts to the project.
joined: 2010
