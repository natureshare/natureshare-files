    text: Olearia ssp similar to O. phlogopappa but with smaller and narrower leaves. Could be a new species. Only found in this location. Any ideas Russell??

    text: Possibly the newly named (in 2013) O. phlogopappa var. salicina. If so it is an important record because is it known from Anglesea to the Otways then an isolated record at the Grampians but nothing in between.
