    text: 'Hi Kevin. You would really need underneath shots to hope for an ID - gills, ring, volva, stipe. There are some sand-loving laccaria (reddish mostly) around Vic (but not described yet?) Also Amanita xanthocephala is very orange, likes sand,  but usually has some crusty granular remains of the universal veil on cap. '
