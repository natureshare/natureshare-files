    text: 'VicFlora says Eryngium vesiculosum is quite variable in size, so this could just be a large specimen.'

    text: The bluish tinge to floral bracts indicates Eryngium ovinum.

    text: It is growing in a wetland so ovinum is unlikely. It has been a very wet year by any standards so maybe it is a well developed vesciculosum but the other E v's nearby are all normal size and nowhere near advanced towards flowering. Thanks for your help guys.
