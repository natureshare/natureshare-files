    text: Hi Kevin. This doesn't fit with D. tasmanica because the anther is much longer than the swollen part. I'm not familiar with D. callicarpa but it does occur in this area?

    text: 'Yes, that''s it. I should have picked it. This species tends to be quite tall (1m+) and upright? Leaves are V-shape in cross-section (as per longifolia complex)?'
