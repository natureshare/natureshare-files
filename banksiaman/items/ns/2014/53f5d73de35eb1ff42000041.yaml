    text: Were they all white-flowered or just this one? They are usually pink.

    text: They are all white and only occur at Port Fairy. They are under threat by introduced Sicilian Sea Lavender and recently have been damaged by the high tides but are still there and will come back. Some on Griffiths Island too.
