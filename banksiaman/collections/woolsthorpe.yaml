description: 'The Green Line is a section of the old Warrnambool to Hamilton Railway Line, the railway track is long gone however the reserve still remains under the control of Victrack. In recent years with cattle having been removed from the reserve, the original vegetation is beginning to re-establish itself. This collection is of plants photographed at the Woolsthorpe section by Kevin Sparrow for a project managed by Basalt To Bay Landcare Group and funded by the federal government.'
