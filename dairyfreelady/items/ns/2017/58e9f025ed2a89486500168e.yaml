description: 'Found sleeping on a poster on the wall in the visitor centre at Lake St Clair. Later found on the floor of the main walkway through the centre  & when moved to safety exhibited lovely defensive behaviour: wings flexed right back; body with wasp-like colouring revealed, arched body as though about to sting.'
