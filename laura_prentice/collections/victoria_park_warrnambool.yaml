title: Victoria Park Warrnambool
description: 'Nature in a 14ha park next to the industrial estate in Warrnambool. Community groups in the 1980''s planted native trees and the park retains a small amount of remnant native grasses. Its a place where we can all get close to nature in the town. We hope to see an increase in birds as "Friends of Victoria Park"plants more native understory plants. '
