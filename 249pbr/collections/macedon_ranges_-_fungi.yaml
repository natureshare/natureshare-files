title: Macedon Ranges - Fungi
description: 'The purpose of this group it to provide a photographic record of fungi species found within the Macedon Ranges. Images should be sharp, close, and include features necessary for identification such as cap detail, gills/pores/spines and stem detail where possible. Not all fungi can be readily identified to species level without the aid of detailed microscopic examination and it is also not necessarily easy to identify the genus. We wish to record all species found in the ranges, both named and unnamed. While it is not intended that this be a "post your image for identification" site, efforts will be made to correct or offer names where possible. For areas to the west of Woodend see the Wombat Forest - Fungi group.'
