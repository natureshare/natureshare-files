title: Drummond & nearby forests - Fungi
description: 'The purpose of this group it to provide a photographic record of fungi species found in the district. Images should be sharp, close, and include features necessary for identification such as cap detail, gills/pores/spines and stem detail where possible. Not all fungi can be readily identified to species level without the aid of detailed microscopic examination and it is also not necessarily easy to identify the genus. We wish to record all species found in the region, both named and unnamed. While it is not intended that this be a "post your image for identification" site, efforts will be made to correct or offer names where possible. The district is roughly defined as reaching from Harcourt/Mt Alexander in the north to Trentham in the south and bounded by the Calder Hwy on the east and Midland Hwy in the west. Small isolated forest areas such as Black Hill and Bald Hill near Kyneton are also included.'
