title: Wombat Forest - Fungi
description: 'The purpose of this group it to provide a photographic record of fungi species found within the Wombat Forest. Images should be sharp, close, and include features necessary for identification such as cap detail, gills/pores/spines and stem detail where possible. Not all fungi can be readily identified to species level without the aid of detailed microscopic examination and it is also not necessarily easy to identify the genus, however we wish to record all species found in the forest, both named and unnamed. While it is not intended that this be a "post your image for identification" site, efforts will be made to correct or offer names where possible. There is some overlap with the northern parts of the forest and the Drummond & nearby forest group and a separate group has been established for Macedon Ranges - Fungi.'
