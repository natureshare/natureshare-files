description: This one is Cymatoplex sp. 1 from MoV 4 and while the image was taken without a flash you can see the differences in the upper wing from the previous specimen. The original image - also attached - was taken under an incandescent light bulb and the primary image has had some PhotoShop work to try and correct the colour.
