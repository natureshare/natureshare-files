    text: Inset is at Anglesea. I'm not really sure about this one it certainly looked the same as the Anglesea specimen on the Computer. and it does show a hint of pink through the sack. I didn't ID it in the field. Its very tiny. Anyway here it is again.

    text: If you click on the earlier post to open it you can use the edit details to add the image back to that record. I suggest you then delete this record so it is only on the system once

    text: Mycocalia denudata has several records for Victoria and M. duriaeana has not been recorded. Unfortunately this genus was not listed in Cunningham's Gasteromycetes of Australia and New Zealand but both the species listed here are depicted in my most comprehensive British field guide. The former species has yellow brown peridioles while the latter has red brown peridioles. As the inset image is from a different location it does not assist with this identification. I think Mycocalia spp. is the safest option here.

    text: I realise this the inset looks like duriaeana as was tracked down as such by I think Tom May. Its a pity I didn't realise what it was at the time. I am however getting my eyes fixed at the moment so next time I'll be able to see more clearly. Also while I'm at it what constitutes the Otways. The Anglesea Heath? the Beach at Aireys Inlet (some good stuff there) The Swamp at Anglesea ?.  Forest Road and or Cecil track. Gherang Gherang Reserve ? If this are all included I could tickle this along for quite some time with a lot of unusual species. Cheers R
