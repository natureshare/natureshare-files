    text: 'It is not dissimilar to C. hawksii and the host seems smaller than usual for that species (see my image in the Otway group). Perhaps a smaller host has produced a scaled down fruiting body however the transition between the fertile section of the club and the base, is not abrupt like you expect for C. hawksii. A very interesting find.'
