    text: 'Asperoinocybe sp. This name was given over on Flicker and resembles a similar species from that genus. I have seen this species on three occasions in the Lorne area. It produces a thick Mycelium around litter and eventually produces fruiting bodies with  a Cap to about 15mm in diam. It was initially confused with Astophera mirabilis. It has been collected and forwarded to the Herbarium and to date no information has been forwarded. '
