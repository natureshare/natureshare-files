    text: 'There is only one collection of this species listed for Australia on the Virtual Herbarium, although there are several for New Zealand. There have been a number of recent observations recently and I suspect the FNCV group has made more collections that have not yet been listed. Records overseas are for tropical Central and South America. The bright colour aids identification.'
