    text: his species is listed as Cordyceps taylorii in gates p219. However this species is also described as large to 30cm and not unlike C robertsii. Some dispute here. Specimen here 2 to 3 cm.

    text: 'Agree, some dispute here. The Willis paper on Cordyceps from Muelleria does not provide any answers however they has long been uncertainty around C. taylorii.'
