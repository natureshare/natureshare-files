    text: 'Seems to fit the description of C. hobsonii. It definitely has a pink sporeprint. Which would make it an Entoloma or a Clitopilus. The fan shaped Entoloma is found on well rotted logs with a visible Mycelium so that probable discounts it. There are at least 3 sp of fan shaped in the Clitopilus camp with hobsonii being the most likely.. '
