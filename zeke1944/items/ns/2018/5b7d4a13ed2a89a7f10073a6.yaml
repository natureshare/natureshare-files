    text: "The specimens collected in WA can be viewed at Amanitaceae.org at \r\nhttp://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+arenaria\r\nThey show fully formed (but unopened) caps and a very woolly stipe not unlike a Rozites stipe. Has Theresa Lebel seen these images? I suggest that the habitat from the WA collection and yours are extremely similar but I am not sure they are the same species. There are more truffle-like and sequestrate species of Amanita out there and I need to do more research but this is an extremely interesting find none the less."
