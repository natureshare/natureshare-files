    text: "Could this species be added in the same way we have done other such as Xylaria \"Spikey\". e.g. Mycena sp. nov. sensu Gates & Ratkowsky(1) 2016 / aff Mycena mamaku\r\nI have also found this species in the Otways on Wild Dog Rd and also on tree fern, unfortunately I had focus issues with the camera but you can see the gills are sometimes decurrent."
