    text: 'I am not sure there is enough evidence to record it as Camarophyllopsis kearneyi. It clearly looks to be a Camarophyllopsis species, but the stipe seems too pale and we cannot see the full upper surface of the pileus to confirm the darker centre. Young describes the pileus margin as crenulate and shows it strongly so in his line drawing however his image in the same publication indicates this is not a constant feature. The correct genus is Camarophyllopsis, not Camarophyllus. Could  Camarophyllopsis spp. be added to the database please.'

    text: There is an image in one of Tony Young's books which looks a lot like this. Have posted another image of a more mature specimen
