    text: 'This was transferred from Paecilomyces to Isaria in 2005 and is the anamorph (asexual phase) of Cordyceps takaomontana which according to Mycobank is a synonym of Cordyceps tenuipes. Following the changes to the Code of Nomenclature discussed recently with the Hypocrea/Trichoderma species, it is clear that the correct name will eventually be adopted by ALA and the indications are that Cordyceps tenuipes is the winner.'
