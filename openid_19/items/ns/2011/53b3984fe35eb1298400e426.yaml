description: 'Welcome swallow. Had 5 nests around our house in 2010 instead of the usual one. Top photo had 5 to fledgling stage although 1 died the first week following. Lower photo had 4. Another, also in carport had 3. Other two nests were too high to check. Excelle'

    text: 2009 the only nest was used twice and there were more four adults feeding the fledgelings. There has been a swallow nest whithin a few inches of the same spot for the last 15 years at least. As it gets rebuilt it moves slightly.
