    text: 'Hi Chris, Thanks for your comments. Unfortunately I don''t have further photos of this, but I don''t think it can be Drymophlia cyanocarpa. The photos I can find of that show a very prominent ovary at the base of the flower cup, whereas my specimen has an opening into the throat of the flower tube. From memory, I think the height of the plant was about 50-60 cm but I don''t have further details. The leaves that you can see (out of focus) are similar to Drymophila but it is a bit of a long shot to get an identification from this one photo. Sorry I can''t be more helpful and thanks for trying.'

    text: 'After a lot of further research, it seems most likely that this is Sparaxis bulbifera, an invasive species from South Africa. Further west in Vicrtoria and into South Australia, it was growing in the roadside drains and adjacent grassland in huge swathes, in a very open environment. In contrast, this isolated example was in quite shaded bushland close to the Sheaok Falls. On close inspection of the flower, it''s just possible to see a bit of purple colouring on the underside of the flower tips where they are curled over. This purple streaking is prominent on the outside of the flower, but only just visible in this example. The 3-parted style is typical of an Iridaceae species.'
