    text: 'Ian Thompson confirmed ID and added "... both observations are G. leptogonium. The pustules are more obvious on yours as there has been a few weeks'' fruit development post flowering. Chris''s images only have the ovaries at flowering time so the pustules are less conspicuous. However, in his top image, when I clicked on x2048 and with magnifier on, I could see white specks around the perimeter of the ovaries corresponding to pustules. Both records show the typical bristliness of the plants and the long peduncles."'
