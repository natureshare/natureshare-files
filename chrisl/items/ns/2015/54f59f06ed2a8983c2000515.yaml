    text: 'This superb beetle is Trachymela sloanei. They are a commercial pest of overseas eucalyptus plantations including California. They are supposed to mimic gumnuts and are sometimes called gumnut leaf beetles. The larvae are considered to be nocturnal, feeding at night and retreating under bark in the daytime. The genus Trachymela is large (127) and few can be easily identifies. They feature dull colors and tubercles (warty processes) on the elytra. Newly eclosed specimens may have a white powder over their whole body that will disperse over time.'

    text: 'Many thanks Martin. The closest I could find was a photo of Reiner Richter posted on Bowerbird, of which you identify as Trachymela. So I was on the right path... Cheers.'
