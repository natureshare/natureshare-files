    text: 'Similar to Paropsis augusta, having the pair of 3 lateral lines along the elytra. Not the same in other respects.'

    text: "This is possibly Paropsisterna cloelia.  Possibly Paropsis variicollis.\r\nMy keys do not adequately describe this beetle and I an left undecided.\r\n  \r\nParopsis usually have crenulate pronotum and strongly punctured as in augusta, and that is a much larger beetle.    brunnea has an entirely black head and antennae.   The black hind part of the head should exclude cloelia. \r\nhttp://www.brisbaneinsects.com/brisbane_leafbeetles/EucalyptusLeaf4.htm \r\nThe reduced striae and beading should exclude variicollis .  "

    text: 'I found more than half a dozen of this colour on both Eucalyptus tricarpa and E. polyanthemos leaves. Found only two of the yellow variicollis, which were possibly slightly larger than all of these. I''m afraid I do not know what to look for, nor have a key. Feel free to assign your preferred identification - even provisional name. Thanks for the discussion Mark and Martin.'

    text: 'I do think it is Paropsisterna variicollis but my sources are too vague to be certain.  Blackburn says ''green or brown and not very variable.''  Chris Reid will not give any opinion without a dissection.  Yes, I have some nightmares; some creatures just don''t fit into our boxes.'
