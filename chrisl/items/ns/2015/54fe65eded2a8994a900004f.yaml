    text: "Thanks Martin. Was a very obliging subject in front of the camera and ring flash in its flash. Assuming I got the species right. Used your ID of the three big blotches, which was perfect for 2 other individuals that I found with this one.\r\nI'm still scratching my head about the red/orange Paropsisterna (that Mark thought you might have nightmares over!). I'm seeing lots of them, and always distinctive in colour from P. variicollis. Cheers."

    text: 'I''m pleased that you are noticing these beetles and am glad to assist in making ID possible for most of them.   I share exactly your dilemma about the orange/red one.  I see them commonly in restricted locations to the west of Melbourne.  There are two or three others which give me concern about the identifications of species that seem to graduate seamlessly into other species when considering the variations.  Paropsisterna variicollis is a good example.  P. decolorata  is another.  And there are a couple of very common species for which I can still not find a reliable name.   I shall list these few unknown paropsisterna when I get back form Sydney next week.  '
