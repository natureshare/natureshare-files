    text: 'Hi Chris, This spider looks similar to Zygometis lactea, but the legs don''t have the same markings, although your spider does have dark markings on two legs.  Wonder if the species is variable.  It looks to be a very beautiful spider.'

    text: "Check out this website - http://www.findaspider.org.au/find/spiders/335.htm\r\n  It appears that the dark markings on the legs are only on the males.  I think this one must be a female."
