title: Brisbane Ranges surrounds - Plants
description: "This collection has been developed to cover the plants within the landscape of the Brisbane Ranges that surround the Brisbane Ranges National Park and Steiglitz Historic Park, but do not include observations within these reserves. Plant names will be added progressively as observations are made.\r\nMuch of the surrounding land of the national park is native vegetation owned by private landholders or part of local government road reserves.\r\nBe sure to visit the collection called \"Brisbane Ranges significant flora\" to add any of your observations that are relevant to that collection.\r\n\r\nFor more info or questions, please email: brisbanerangesproject@gmail.com"
