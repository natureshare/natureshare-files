description: 'I''m not sure which of the 2 varieties it could be - Urostrictus or Engaeus tuberculatus - as I live close to a creek & but also on a slope away from stream but with plenty water.  (I have larger resolution photos - though I took them with an automatic camera, so the focus is not great, unfortunately - as it was a rare and chance occurrence this morning). '
