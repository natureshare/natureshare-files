description: 'I found this in my yard a few weeks ago and after much to-and-fro on some Facebook wildlife identification pages - we identified is as the ''Endoxyla'' (size approx 10cm, Female). We thought it might be - . ''Endoxyla Leucomocla or Ghost Moth, Goats moth but settled on Endoxyla - which is known in the Dandenong Ranges and has a similar wing pattern and size (approx 10cm), and colouring (red tinged, tho most gone on this specimen).

    text: 'From Peter Marriott: E. leucomochla is normally a dry-country thing and is found in the west of the state. The photographed specimen from the Dandenongs is not it (The Dandenongs one has brown hind wings, brown on top (dorsally) of the abdomen, a grey thorax with a black line, grey scales along the costa and probably over much of the forewings). There are two or three grey coloured moths (affinis, magnifica) and about 5 without names. The loss of scales is too extreme to be able to put a name to it. So Endoxyla sp. it should remain.'
