    text: "This looks to me like Pterostylis chlorogramma, could that be correct?\r\n\r\nThe dark green stripes, thinner labellum, no brown nose tips and the lateral sepals hang down flat rather than round"

    text: Thanks for the comment Tim. It's certainly possible and is one I hadn't considered. Someone with more knowledge than me might like to comment.

    text: 'Great discussion of identifying these P. longifolia complex orchids by Tim Entwhistle at http://talkingplants.blogspot.com.au/2016/10/greenhood-orchid-taller-greener-later.html  Following this I would tend to favour P. chlorogramma over P. smaragdina and not P. melagramma.'

    text: "Another thing is the flower size. The all have varying flower sizes and leaf numbers. Although typically the leaves seem to be in the 1-8 range which doesn't rule anything out. \r\n\r\n"
