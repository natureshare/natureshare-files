    text: ALA/AFD do not list Ellipsidion humeralis but do list Ellipsidion humerale. Bowerbird has it the other way around and contributors use both as alternative spellings. As we follow the ALA/AFD

    text: '... as we follow the ALA/AFD I feel that E. humerale should be used in NatureShare even though E. humeralis is widely used. Also David Rentz in his book, Cockroaches of Australia uses E. humerale. '

    text: I've added E. humerallis as a synonym of E. humerale - a solution of convenience which may or may not be technically correct.
