    text: 'This looks like Mycena mulawaestris, it is not always as gloopy as the image presented in Fuhrer, A Field Guide to Australian Fungi. Its a shame you did not get a shot of the gills which are white with a dark line along the edge. The remnant gloop and the very dark acutely-pointed umbo are typical of this species.'

    text: 'The velvety stems was the part that concerned me about the ID, however Grgurinovic''s book on Mycena advises the stems have cystidia (not technically the correct term) which would account for their appearance.'
