    text: 'Lorraine, I found a similar fungus at Sorrento back in July. At the time I had a ? about the ID but wondered if it might be Coprinus plicatilis (based on info in the FNCV fungi booklets). I''ll post my photo shortly.'

    text: 'Sorry, I am caught up with other work for a few days but I suggest you download the Perth Field Book - www.wanaturalists.org.au/files/2011/11/FieldBook_2017-Edn-final.pdf - This has a number of Coprinus species not covered in the average guide book and will provide some insight. I do not think this is Parasola.'

    text: The dung looks non native and there is a small granular button on the dung to the right in the background plus there are granules of veil remains on the cap. All indicate this is not Parasola plicatilis as it is not a dung species and does not carry veil remains. There are a couple of interesting possibilities in the European/English texts which I will explore further on the weekend.

    text: Thanks John. Unfortunately I only noticed the button on the computer screen so I don't have another photo of it.
