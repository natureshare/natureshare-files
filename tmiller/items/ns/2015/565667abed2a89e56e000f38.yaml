    text: Great sighting Tom. Seems this spot has some great treasures. Have you considered setting up a Collection for the Gun Club in Natureshare? Not hard to do and you can then map all the observations together and keep track of a growing list. Maybe do a collection for flora and another for fauna. Yell out if you need help. Chris.
